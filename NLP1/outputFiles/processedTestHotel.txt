| |when making my reservation i made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer memorial day | the staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate | the suites are very spacious clean cozy and comfortable | upon on arriving staff were friendly willing to exceed expectations and serve me with enthusiasm | the hot breakfast was delicious each morning | the beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest | i would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other chicago hotels | |my husband and i stayed at the james chicago hotel for our anniversary | this place is fantastic | we knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice | the rooms are beautiful and the staff very attentive and wonderful | | the area of the hotel is great since i love to shop i couldn't ask for more | | we will definatly be back to chicago and we will for sure be back to the james chicago | betsy m louisville ky| |booked through hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage | the 'view' was of the 'inner courtyard' of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms | you were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night | they no longer have in-room coffee appliances | you either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room or go around the corner to starbucks or mcdonald's | internet access is not free $12 |95/24 hours the gift shop is a joke tucked away in the corner of the coat check room concierge services have limited hours and the business center is open only during 'business hours' which made it difficult to get work done after 'business hours | i would not stay there ever again nor do i recommend it to anyone | i have had better stays at any holiday inn express | |me and my husband stayed in the allegro hotel chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently | we got a room with a king size bed | | although the room is small we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages & all | however we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us | the walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound | 1 of the days our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign | the worst is upon returning to the hotel at night we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage | the housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins | this is unacceptable to us | the hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night | although it is near the cta trains i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view | am staying again at a kimpton hotel in san fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change | overall not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to chicago again | |after staying at the james chicago last weekend i can honestly say i will be going for affordability on my next trip | the james chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected | the chairs in the room looked like something out of ikea | i love chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay | i believe i would have been better off and happier staying at the holiday inn | you don't always get what you pay for | |my husband and i were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4 easily changed | first morning coldcold shower didn't complainnext day fine | phone did not work called every day to complain and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room never was | no dial tone unable to call restaurant or call for car or call for room service | finally on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it | the hotel is beautiful rooms great and everyone was so nice even when i was complaining they were nice | great gym area also and love the restaurant | but for the money i could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone | |my company booked our group for a conference and sales meeting | the service was friendly helpful and the property was beautiful | the hotel was clean and filled with history | we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the rate was reasonable as well | |this was a great place to be | great views of river and lake walk to everything a clean and comfortable room and very accommodating staff | we arrived early and were checked in by 1030 am and checked out late  effectively adding two days to our vacation | it is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers | |the chicago palmer house disappointed me | i chose it because it a hilton hotel but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name | my first impression was a negative one when i was greeted by a rather rude staff | my room might have been luxurious years ago but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening | the bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible | the food served by the room service and at the hotel's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine | the food simply did not deliver its promises | everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small | the location of the hotel might seem like an advantage since it is in downtown chicago nearby many touristic attractions however the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by | overall this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the hilton name and price range | |i was really excited when we booked a night at the hard rock hotel in chicago | it was actually beyond our budget but my husband and i needed a weekend away so i decided to splurge for the occasion | worst waste of my money ever | | | our room was smaller than pictured online and it looked like the maid didn't vacuum the carpet | we visited the hotel restaurant angels and kings one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husband's steak was cooked wrong he ordered medium but received a well-done steak | by the end of our trip we were so glad to leave but they were under-staffed and the sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out | chicago was a fun city but next time we return i'll be choosing a different hotel - and i suggest you do too | | |located right in the heart of downtown chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip | the first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is and how clean the rooms are even compared to other luxury hotels seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the terrace and get a drink i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed i've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent bed was soft and the tv didn't appear burned out at all | overall i give this a five out of five the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect i wish i could have stayed longer | |if you are traveling to chicago and need a place to stay i highly recommend the hotel allegro chicago | it was visiting time visiting chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the hotel allegro | he said they were pet friendlywhich was a huge plus | this is because i hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time i travel for business | upon my arrival i was met with friendly valet who treated me like i was the only customer who mattered | i walked in and saw a hotel like no other i have seen before or after | the lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place i could relax in | after i had entered and checked in i saw the staircase which looked like a testament to the staircase in the titanic | frankly i was amazed and i had not even entered my room yet | my room was a queen deluxe room and it was amazing | the bed had a blue headboardwhich i have never seen before and the colors worked together so well i seriously contemplated living there | the room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food i ordered | later i wanted to get a drink and i enjoyed it at the bar 312 which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel | these are the specifics of my stay but there is much more to be experienced that i did not mention if you visit the hotel allegro | in summary they allow pets the service is amazing the decoration superb and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments | what more could a person ask for | |i will never stay at conrad chicago again | the employees were rude from the begining | when i asked for extra towels the lady at the front desk looked like i was an inconveniece | the bar staff wasn't much better | the maids never came and changed our sheet during our stay | do not go there | |the swissotel chicago was by far the best hotel i have ever stayed at in chicago | it was clean modern and the staff were very friendly even to our large family with cranky kids at a very late hour | the room was fantastic and you can not beat it for the price | not only was the room fantastic but so was the view | our room looked out over the skyline and it was breathtaking especially at night | the best part of the hotel was its location | it was located within walking distance to so many fun attractions including navy pier and the sears tower | our stay was wonderful and we can't wait to go back again | |downtown chicago has a multitude of available hotels | however once youve decided to step away from the ordinary a fantastic way to get away from it all is by booking a stay at the homewood suites | the combination of luxury and affordability is evident as soon as youve entered the glamourous lobby | the downtown homewood suites is located near all the attractions which make chicago the diverse and culturally rich town that is world known | the hotel offers a free fitness center high speed wireless internet as well as a complimentary buffet breakfast | being a member of the hilton family ensures the utmost in quality and service which has been observed by millions of customers around the world | |the concierge was so helpful | without hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful | they even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating's | loved the health club at the back of the hotel | by joining the presidents club it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities | the rooms were large updated and had views looking out in 3 directions | the coffee maker in the room was exceptional | location is great for getting mostly anywhere | parking is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground millennium garage that was only $25 |00 per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel | |dispite what other are saying this was one if not the best hotel stay in chicago i have had | i travel to the big city about three times a year for pleasure and the james rates up with the best | i was upgraded and the staff made the stay worth my special weekend visit | i don't believe you will be disapointed | |the talbott hotel - my girlfriend and i stayed at the talbott last weekend for leisure our 2 year anniversary | check-in was fairly quick | when we got to our room we were blown away | our room king guest room was extremely nice and high quality | despite our room having a huge king size bed there was still an ample around a floor space and roominess in general | the bed itself was dangerously comfortable so much so that i almost fell asleep the minute i tried it out | the bathroom was just as roomy as the main area and had a separate shower from tub | the best part of the bathroom was the sink strange to hear but true | the dual vanity sink was made of beautiful granite and allowed my girlfriend i enough space to use each sink at the same time with no problem | bathroom amenities were molton brown | we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant little market brasserie the first night because we were tired and it was anything but a backup choice | the menu was pleasantly diverse and the quality of the ingredients was excellent | location of the hotel is approximately 2 blocks from washington square park and made for easy sight seeing | overall we were very pleased with our stay and recommend this hotel to all | |after staying at the sheraton royal orchid hotel in bangkok i was expecting a similar experience at the chicago sheraton | i had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience | unfortunately my expectations were not met | for the past 3 years i stayed at the palmer house in the loop but thought i'd try a more modern hotel | pros - location by the chicago river two blocks from michigan avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment - buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes crepes and french toast cons - check-in assigned me to a city view room when i had prepaid for a river view room - river view was good but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was unimpressive bathtub-shower combination worn plumbing fixtures only 2 sets of towels provided - guest room was small only one soft chair provided - guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway - 7 to 8 block walk to nearest l-station - concierge couldn't explain how to get to the mercury theatre nor print a map of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the link cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were operational at the link cafe where boarding passes can be printed| |i stayed at the affnia hotel in chicago and was extremely unsatisfied | i would recommend everyone to avoid this hotel | i paid $700 overall for 2 nights in a cheap small untidy room | granted i've stayed at hotels of similar quality but never have i paid so much for one of them | i could not believe what i saw when i walked into the room | | |it was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall that had been painted over | the breakfast i ordered wasn't terrible but certainly wasn't good | the wifi connection was horrendously slow | if you want to spend a big buck on a hotel fine | | |just don't spend it here | |talbot hotel- i have certain expectations for my hotel as i travel on business frequently and quite honestly the talbot did not do it for me | yes i understand it is close to all the clubs for younger people but it should also at the same time provide some of the features they promise | the wifi was not high speed at all i found myself needing to walk to different corners of the room just to get a signal | room service was 24 hours but it was extremely slow the two times i ordered and the staff didn't even apologize for their tardiness | overall this place gave me a room to stay in but didn't give me any enjoyment from an already stressful work trip | |if you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you're willing to pay a little extra i'd recommend this place |also pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular |a short walk to michigan avenue | excellent service from the valets concierge lobby agents and waitstaff in the restaurants | the food in the restaurants was great and room service wasn't too shabby either |well worth the money | |excellent location about a block from michigan ave | and two blocks from water tower place and john hancock tower | beautiful hotel felt very luxurious and high-class for being a moderate priced hotel | staff was excellent -- friendly and accommodating | |i booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the magnificent mile christmas lights parade | i chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed | we arrived at our hotel around 330 pm to check in | we came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 300 pm | after giving him our name the manager saidok we have your king smoking suite available | we quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room | he insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room | we went back and forth then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation | luckily we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone | it clearly said non-smoking | after showing him our reservation he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available | so why in the world did he need to see our reservation | | we decided to see if we could handle the smoking room | it turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children | the manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed | we canceled our room reservation | we live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home | my family was very disappointed | my husband is a gold member with hilton | let's just say we will be switching back to marriott | the hotel lobby was dated | the smoking room that i saw looked very dated as well | they made an error and never owned up to it nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience | |our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and instead of helping a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us | they had trouble locating our reservation | our room was tiny | when i'm paying over $400 a night for a room i expect to be able to walk around in it | the beds were also tiny | the walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door | this hotel was probably once beautiful and classy but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs | won't be staying here again | |my stay at the talbott was a wonderful experience | the service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations the gold coast location is close to michigan ave the museums and many of the other sites chicago has to offer |if you are visiting chicago i highly recommend the talbott | |when we stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced | our room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby | and finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor | the room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side | our experience was definitely not a pleasant one | to make matters even worse we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left | i am never coming back to millennium knickerbocker hotel | |visiting during a busy 2day conference in chicago | most hotels booked solid | the full hotel allows you to meet a wide array of customers | everyone is complaining about service cleanliness and overall experience | location is good | hotel is tired | employees surly | too many cool properties to choose from in this town will never stay here again and will re-think hilton in general| |i am usually a big fan of kimpton hotels but this place is awful  | | | i would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left | it is an old dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more botique  | the carpets are dirty and tattered patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet | yuck | | | the bathrooms are tiny and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them | when we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way | we woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table | we told the front desk called housekeeping and then called the front desk again | |finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum | the elevators are slow and often only one is working at any given time | i did not find the staff to be friendly at all except for one waiter  breakfast | what a disappointment| |this is one of my favorite sheratons/starwood properties | i have stayed at a lot of hotels mostly starwood in chi but all around this is my favorite based on cost amenities and downtown location | i really like it beginning with unloading the taxi because i am greeted by nick who has been there for years | he gives the best greeting from la to ny and is always happy | he obviously loves his job | people at the front desk are always nice and efficient | if you like to workout roberta runs their fitness center | another one who loves their job and serves guests well | great lake / river view while working out | on this particular trip i was caught in a pinch however christy the former mgr was able to take care of a frequent guest | i considered it a minor miracle based on hotel availability | the maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient | another great experience | |my stay at the hilton was like living in luxury for a few days | i never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel | during my stay i could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge | in fact they didn't charge for wifi morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service | the lobby always had complimentary coffee tea soda and meals | i felt like a queen | this hotel deserves highest marks for service | |talbot hotel- came out to chicago for my buddie's bachelor party | we are from the midwest and we thought this was intuitive so we decided to stay at the talbot | we had a great time it was rowdy of course but it was pleasant to stay in such a central area close to all the clubs | in the heart of the gold coast we were right where you want to be when it comes to nightlife | but the rooms themselves were extremely well set up | the suite was the way to go we had 42 inch tv newspaper delivery and high-speed wireless which helped us form our gameplan for exploring our new area | the sofas were essential too and very conducive to having multiple people in one room together | overall this hotel was ideal spacious with all the amenities you would ever need but also close to any place we would ever want to go | |i had really high hopes for this hotel | the location seemed great and the prices were too | unfortunatley you get what you pay for | despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier there weren't many other redeeming qualities | the staff was very rude | we arrived late after a long drive from detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in | once we finally got checked in our room hadn't been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people | we were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they couldn't get to it until morning | we had planned on seeing some of chicago's attractions like the field museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go | their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them | finally when we checked out they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night | ridiculous | |this hotel was perfect for our girls getaway | the decor is fun & refreshing | loved the roof top bar | every staff member was friendly & always smiling | the location is perfect for michigan ave shopping the beach dinner and night life | it was a mile or two from millenium station | the concierge recommended a couple places to hang out after dinner and added our names to the guest list i'm sure they do it all the time but still a nice gesture | |allegro - i stayed in allegro hotel’s king suite in december when i visited chicago for a company event | i have to say that my stay was absolutely pathetic | even though i had booked the room earlier it seemed that they had not arranged for it | i had to wait for more than an hour at the reception even though i turned up late in the afternoon | the staff did not even seem to be bothered and their apology seemed superficial | also when i used the bathroom in the morning the jacuzzi was not working which is something that i hated because i did not have enough time to request for a room change | only the food which i ordered through room service was good | otherwise i would never recommend this hotel to anyone | |everything you would would expect from a top-notch hotel and exceeded by the service | the trendy decor and easy to access dining gave us a 'second-wind' pick up after a day of sight-seeing | this hotel is definitely the place that i want to come back to | by the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights my wife and i wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful swiss flare | one of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window | the feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind | |worst high priced hotel i've ever stayed at | i had a business meeting in chicago and heard good reviews from a few co-workers thought it would be a nice place to stay but was a little upset with my experience with swissotel in chicago |front desk clerk was very rude at check in valet parking was great until they brought my suv around front with a quarter size dent in the passenger size door the hotel refused to pay for the damages | the room was very beautiful besides the faint mildew smell in the room | room service was great and very pleasing |our business meeting took place in the st gallen room where our meeting took a little disruptive turn there was construction going on during that time and was very hard to hear the announcer in our meeting | other than that the hotel was beautiful but the stay wasn't as great as i expected you may want to book somewhere else if you have a business meeting to attend in chicago | |after a my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago i contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it | while the amenities were plush the service of the staff was lacking | upon check in my reservation was lost and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay | there was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way | room service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room | a used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out | i am not sure my sheets were changed out | when i checked out the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report i spent days creating | overall my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers | i will be relunctant to stay with them again until i am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better | |we connected to affinia chicago thorugh a city websight | the deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included | there was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that | they are currently under major construction | they will be a little late of their projections in the finish date | i must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances | the room was complete and was good | it had a very nice bathroom | the main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food drink or rest room opportunities | the construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 900am | i think this will be a good one once they are done | as of the end of may they have a way yet to go | |i was attending a conference at the mariott | they were booked up and i shared a room at the hard rock for a week by default | what a lucky break | this is a beautiful hotel | i am not a fan of all that black/grey vibe and find it a little cheesy | what i loved was the way the hard rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact and decorated around the basic stucture | my room was clean clean clean | i want to comment on the staff | what an upbeat group of people | this included the doormen the front desk the consierge | they were wonderful | every morning one of the bell men would find my tv morning news show for me in the bar while i drank their courtesy coffee | they brought us a refrigerator ipod dock and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in | i had a hard time contacting the airport transport | the consierge took care of it for me | while i was waiting for the 450 am airport shuttle one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back | i just couldn't get over how nice and friendly everyone was | | | |great place to stay | i hope to go back with my husband | |my husband and i stayed at the hyatt regency chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary | we could not have picked a better locate | the price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget | the flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine | my husband loved the stetson steakhouse and the 24 hour stay fit gym | we really did not leave the hotel during i stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away | if we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay | this hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and i | what a wonderful ten years celebration | |while this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing i would not recommend this hotel to anyone | the rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel ever | | the crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again | the newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet | the shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean | this hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely band-aides | there is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface probaly concrete with no pad in between | the lobby is smokey because of the large open bar in the small space | we were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights we left after 2 and went to another hotel | |my stay was quick but awesome | after a long day seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner but then i saw the self-serve kiosks | i was checked in with keys in hand in under 3 minutes | in the morning i was able to check out on the tv in my room | the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its 1927 origins | the bed was fabulously comfortable | i wish i could live there | they have many rooms wtih 2 bathrooms | i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didn't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms | talk about squeals of delight | that was about 7 years ago in virginia beach | i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms but it's the first time i've seen this since | what a great feature | |my stay at the the james was perfect | my room was thoughtfully designed the lighting the storage space the bar area the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at | the staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating | the restaurant primehouse echoed the above | great service and one of the best steaks i've had in a very long time | |i stayed at the monaco for the labor day weekend when i visited my family in chicago | it is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life | clean comfortable and pretty | the rooms were clean and the staff is very caring | i needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink | the front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes | i will recommend monaco to anyone who will be staying in the chicago area | |the affinia hotel is beautiful | it's in a great location the service is top-notch and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious | the look of the hotel is very modern but it feels warm and cozy too | the restaurant is amazing | i thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back | if you're planning a trip to chicago check this place out | |my daughter and i were in chicago for one night after having attended a three-day conference elsewhere in illinois | we were only in chicago on our way home | we didn't know where to stay in chicago but booked one night at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers based on their ad in the chicago visitors guide | we're glad we did | we enjoyed our stay very much | our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city | that's what we wanted--a great view and we got it | also the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it wasn't bad--saved us a lot of money | the elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available | we found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating | the only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in chicago | we wish we could have stayed there at the sheraton for at least another night | we would definitely stay there again | |my husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night | i called the hotel and spoke with eric he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation he said no and that was the end of it | my husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookit |com as well | i called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement | i informed courtney from bookit |com that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by eric | she spoke with the mgr erica and she said erica would honor that if i could provide a name | i got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he didnt recall saying that | i was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied | | | | | | | | | | | he said no ma'am i dont remember saying that | i said so since you dont remember thats it | | | i said my husband heard him say it b/c he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there | i asked to speak to erica told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on | i asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth | i have never writte | a review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this | erica was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome | very disappointed | | will never stay again | | |the intercontinental chicago hotel terrible | first of all the continental breakfast was a joke | the food was unhealthy and unsatisfactory | after our first night we expected the maid to come clean up our room | we came back from site-seeing to find that our room was in the same condition we left it in | i will never go back to this hotel again | |we had a great experience at this hotel | the hotel is huge | the rooms were very clean well appointed and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park | the staff was so nice and very helpfull | donald at the the concierge desk scored us tickets to wicked the day of the performance and on a holiday weekend too | they were great seats and a reasonable price | he worked very hard for us to see that show | they truely topped off what was a fun new years celebration | this will be my first pick when i return in the spring | |booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful nye and was rather disappointed | bed was either the world's smallest queen or was actually a double not to mention it was uncomfortably springy | some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used q-tips | lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly | when the tv was off there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv | hot water was very inconsistent in the shower | it is in a great location however next time i will try one of the other hotels in the area like the intercontinental or marriott | this might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business but i wouldn't recommend it for a romantic night or two | |the omni was chosen for it's location whichworked out perfectly | the bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean  | | |until | | |i sat down in the tub | | |there was black mold in the soap holder in the cracks on the walls between the tile all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl | needless to say i drained the tub and took a shower | | |i really don't care for showers | oh yes | | |the toilet leaked as well | | |the staff were very helpful but i was disappointed | i travel extensively and don't think i will return | we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel printed the presentation and delivered it to our room | they try | we booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building | | |but we weren't there too much | |whenever i decided to stay at fairmont chicago millennium park the only thing that i had on my mind was the idea of taking that time to relax and enjoy some time with my husband | however the hotel choice wasn't the best | right in the front desk when we arrived there we had problems with our reservation | the room that we had reserved was occupied and so we had to switch to some other room which was much smaller than the original one | the hotel did give us a discount but if i'd paid for the large room was because i wanted the it | a hotel with this name shouldn't put its guests in these kind of situation | i wont be reserving room there again | |fairmont chicago millennium park - fairmont chicago is definitely not worth the fuss they are making | | i mean yes the venue is great but other than that it fails to impress you | while i was in my room i could continuously hear people walking entering the rooms and talking  |it was so annoying | |  the cleaning staff is not that efficient the cleaning lady did not replace the shampoo in the bathroom so i had to call them up and request for it | and it took them 2 hours to actually replace it | | the parking is extremely expensive and so is the food | it doesn’t live up to its award winning standards | frankly i have had better experience at fairmont at other locations | in chicago look for other places to stay | |amalfihotelchicago - i would not recommend this place to others because i felt the room was too stuffy and the staff was not co-operative | the shower in our room was broken and it took nearly 4 hours to get it fixed and they did not even moven us to another room | | if you want to get some work done when you are here then that is nearly impossible because the conference rooms are small and dimly lit | the gym is sub-standard with a lot of equipment either missing or broken | |swissotelchicago – super fast internet | | i always worry when i leave home for a while that the wi-fi will be shoddy but no worries here | all over the hotel it was good on my phone and laptop | me and my brother actually walked from the 53rd floor to the lobby and had good signal everywhere | at the ends of each floor they have these ginormous windows that looked out onto the nearby river and some of the coolest and weirdest skyscrapers i’ve seen in a while | we tried to go to the river later but it started to rain on us so we went to the jacuzzi which we spotted on our tour of the different floors | they wouldn’t bring food up to us in the jacuzzi so i ran down a couple flights of stairs to grab some of the complementary foods from my room which actually weren’t that bad tasting | it stopped raining pretty late at night so we never got to see the river up close but i definitely want to come back here so that i can get a chance to at another time | |we stayed for two nights for a meeting | it is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean | the service was very good as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable | the rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses | the restaurant has good seafood but was a bit expensive | we would come back again | |terrible time at the talbott | when i planned my vacation to chicago i called ahead and made reservations to stay here | when i went to check in i was told i didn't have a reservation knowing my credit card was charged i argued with the guy who was working | finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else | thankfully they knew how to use the computer | i go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet | i could not believe it when i complained i was told to spray some air freshener | i had to go visit family | when i got back my room key did not work | once again there i was complaining to the helpless employee | he told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet | i could not believe the mentality of this guy | i had one more night reserved i could not take it anymore and i went and spent the rest of my vacation at my aunts house | i would not recommend the talbott to anyone | |my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro in march 2006 | we had a great time | we were upgraded to a suite and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with mr | bubbles animal print robes and a luxurious king- sized bed | the suite was very nice and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street | it was very boutiquey and the lobby was lovely | we enjoyed the complementary wine hour | the staff was attentive and our stay in this kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to chicago memorable | we would return here | |just returned from a one night stay at the knickerbocker and i will not return | it came nowhere near being worth the price i paid | hotel burnham is twice the hotel at half the price | the bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly | we had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered which frankly may as well have been paper towels nothing plush about them at all | we didn't have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered | room service cart was left outside our door all night | all in all it was a very disappointing stay | the only redeeming quality of this hotel seems to be its location | and for me it's just not worth it | |thirty years ago we had a tiny room and indifferent service | this time the service was superb and friendly throughout with special commendation for the waiters and waitresses at the coffee shop the door and bell persons and the hilton honors person at the front desk | they even lowered our price to moderately high when we inquired a few days before our stay | when we want to stay south of the river downtown we will be back| |ok i just feel if you're paying well over $200 for a room you should get something to show for it | the location was on michigan ave but if i pay just a little more i could have had way better peninsula park hyatt shoot the omni was 10x better | we ordered a deluxe executive suite and it was so below sub par | the room was very small so small the ice bucket was in the closet the bathroom was just as small just well lit a plus | wallpaper was peeling outlets barely covered no view | the only thing appealing was the bed and that may have been because i was so tired | and we were really excited because this is the palmer house | the palmer house does have nice restaurants the lockwood quiet distinguished and the potter's lounge grown/sexy| |very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel | i travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel | i reserved a king bed | at checkin i was informed they were out of kings and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade | when i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and rattled all night | the tv did not work | had to call for service | the following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced | stay somewhere else | |grant it this hotel seems very nice but i was not at all pleased with my stay here | the customer service was horrible | i had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either | for as much as i paid to stay here you'd think the least you'd get is an iron | not | i had to request an iron too | in addition to all of the failed amenities i was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and wasn't reimbursed until an entire week later | the next time i choose to visit chicago swissotel will be the last place i think to stay | |hard rock hotel is a must to visit | no matter what city your in hard rock hotel is the place to stay | filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining | this hotel is the place to be | great views in every location especially chicago | the service is incredible along with the food and decor | the hotel staff will help you feel right at home no better than home| |a bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance | will definitely stay here again| |as a frequent traveler for both business and pleasure clean and comfortable accommodations at a reasonable price are important to me | homewood suites chicago provides all of that and more | the room was spacious and immaculately kept with all the tools you could need to prepare a meal in the full-sized kitchen | after a busy work day it was wonderful to be able to kick back in front of the huge flat-screen television to relax with a spectacular backdrop of the city outside | i will definitely book a room next time in chicago and i'll definitely continue to stay at homewood suites in other cities | |i visited chicago with my two teenage daughters | homewood suites is amazing | the complimentary breakfast and receptions offer so much variety | the hotel was within walking distance to many places to eat and shop | we got caught in a thunderstorm and got soaking wet | i dried all our clothes in the dryer right in the hotel | the homewood suites was so much like home | the suite was very spacious and had everything we needed | the hotel had lots of brochures and suggestions for dining and activities | the staff was so friendly and helpful | chicago is an amazing place and the homewood suites is the place to stay | i would definitely stay there again | |my husband and i recently chose the palmer house hilton for a rare couple's getaway from our usual life and an escape it truly provided | there is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user | a bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us because things like alarm clocks hairdryers and ironing boards were already there electronic media even available for rent | with a comfortable bed control over how the room felt no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the chicago culture in close proximity | too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning but the hilton was a true vacation | thank you | |after reading good reviews about i booked a 5 night stay | checked in late bit called early in the day to assure we'd have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 teens | they somehow had us booked for two rooms instead | got that sorted out and arrived around 10 pm | checked in and waited for our luggage | | | finally went down and got it ourselves | the room was a little grungy furniture shabby and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover | ewww | called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me | fyi it's kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel | next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didn't work | called for a replacement waited a while called again and was brought another iron which also didn't work | third time was a charm | oh boy | too bad we paid in advance | won't be staying here again | |the ambassador east hotel is a business that certainly strives to keep its customers satisfied | upon my entrance at the ambassador east i was greeted warmly | the staff was incredibly pleasant and the accommodations were top-knotch | the food served at the award-winning pump room was to die for and the service was fast but friendly | |my wife and i stayed here last weekend | it was our honeymoon and it was wonderful | this hotel was so beautiful inside and out | we were more than pleased with our room and the resturant was amazing | all of the staff here were very nice and polite | they helped us with any of our needs | i wish i could live in this place | all together it was one of the best weekends of our lives | we plan on coming back again | great hotel | |i had a horrible time at amalfi | when we approached the reception to check it we were ignored for about 10 minutes | also the lady at the reception was very rude and loud |  the room furniture was cheap and looked as if it wasnâŠ™t cleaned recently |  at night i found out that my room was located close to a trash incinerator and the noises kept me awake all night |  also the manager was not available at night to hear my complaints | i consider my stay total waste money and complete torture | |your website wowed me enough to book online although i had never used your hotel | i had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to chicago and i was very disappointed | the first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk | we had to wait a long time to get checked in | when we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom | the maid hadn't finished the room and she'd left her stuff behind | of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle | the next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one | we knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled non barking pets | this animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep | i called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped | i think the dog just gave up because it didn't sound like the desk staff knew what to do | the crowning disaster at least for my kids and husband was that the remote control for the tv was dead | we managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake | your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great | i cannot recommend it to anyone | |stay away | after generations as an old-world cozy and stately if a bit tired oasis the ae has been purchased by ian schrager and taken down so many notches it's almost not functional | allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation the entrance is not handicapped accessible and i saw several hotel guests with canes casts etc including myself recovering from foot surgery and in a cast with a cane struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel | with luggage it's almost impossible | this is simply inexcusable | i've been a customer of the ambassador east for decades--but no more | the hallways are so dark one can barely see | the rooms are stark white which in and of itself isn't a particular problem but it is jarring and almost painful as one's eyes adjust from the dark hallways | the furniture--stark and scant--looks like something from an ikea closeout | the bed is comfortable--what a relief--but only about 15 inches off of the floor a real problem if you're at all physically challenged or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days | the problems don't end there | my room had a horribly uncomfortable wire/metal desk chair and absolutely nowhere else to sit | no arm chair no demi-sofa no ottoman | with a foot in a cast it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably perhaps even with my leg elevated while in the room | no way | the bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries | not a shelf a small table a nook or a medicine cabinet | if you want to put a razor shaving cream makeup for women or anything else down so that you can use them you're sh*t out of luck | repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet | a borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable something i didn't discover until caught in an expected downpour | i was tempted to throw it out but remembered that they would charge me for it if i didn't return it in spite of its total lack of usefulness | refrigerator--forget it | shampoo | for two days in a row the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion and no shampoo | room service--not available | if you want breakfast the front desk will sell you a small pre-wrapped commercial grade muffin for $4 |00--something you can buy in any gas station for $1 |00 | no added value whatsoever | the photos show a nice entrance and a large lobby for which the ae has long been famous | unfortunately that lobby is closed off under construction and the temporary lobby is on the second floor difficult again for handicapped access | thermos-bottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold at 8 in the morning | when confronted with these various misses the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said yeah we know you're not the first to tell us this stuff | all this shows is that schrager doesn't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right | it's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it's under renovation | it's another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain particularly after booking a non-refundable pre-paid reservation | again avoid this hotel like the plague | |upon entering the hotel monaco chicago i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building | the old fashioned furnishings the wonderful view and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel | at first i had been skeptical but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone | as i entered my room the fresh flowers and the amazing chicago view greeted me | during my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool winding down every night with a comforting massage | i would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities | |the talbott hotel claims to be chicago's premiere small luxury hotel | after staying there and experiencing the service environment and the hotel in general i can say with confidence that this just isn't true | i arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and i was immediately disappointed | no one came to my car to collect my bags and i was forced to lug them inside myself | the doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags | once inside the atmosphere was not what i expected | the lighting was poor leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building | the carpet looked dirty as if it hadn't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage | when i arrived at the front desk i was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me | after checking in i went up to my room and was once again disappointed | the bed was very uncomfortable and i ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water | that night i ordered room service | the food took 45 minutes to get to my room and when it finally arrived it was cold | the fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them | i would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends and probably not to my enemies either | stay away | |the location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to navy pier is just beside the hotel | the room was very spacious | kind of too big for a solo traveler | the view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night | the bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrobe | the kitchen has microwave oven and cooking utensils | some of the cooking utensils were a bit dirty probably because they had not been used for sometime | however the microwave oven was very useful as i can heat up food to eat at night | you can easily walk to the magnificent mile by cutting across the shopping mall across the road | do check out pizzeria uno which is near the hotel that serves the delicious deep dish pizza | for cheaper food do check out the foodcourt at the shopping mall | the hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from mon to thur | i did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent | i will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to chicago | |the hard rock hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into chicago | | the location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as lake michigan millennium park and art museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from | my co-works loved the exterior of the building views from the rooms the art on the walls and crisp clean & hip feeling of the hotel but not too over the top for business | by far a better experience than your usual chain hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms | here you feel special | | |for the same price | the lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on michigan ave or catch a real rock star in the lobby | |swisses chicago nice but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the chicago waterfront | a spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city but don't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning | no free wifi here or affordable breakfast or a free swim in the pool | just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet an on average $25 plate for breakfast and another 15 bucks a night for the fitness center | i've stayed in small town no star motels where wifi is free as part of a 50 dollar room | get with it - this is 2009 | no free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don't need it anyway but for those of us who aren't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated | coffee milk oj stale donuts muffins maybe some cereal | throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby | with regards to swimming this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly | this all makes the $6 fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain | summation drop the fees the nickel dimming of folks and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel | |sofitel - i had a rather mediocre experience at the sofitel | i came for a sudden business meeting during the holiday season and the sofitel was the only hotel for miles that was not booked to capacity | i had a very important proposal to submit to my boss the night i was staying there but the wi-fi was so slow that in the end i was not able to complete it in time | my complaint is that hotels as expensive as the sofitel should at least have a decent wi-fi connection | |the staff at the james chicago hotel seemed determined to make my stay a horrible one | when i entered the establishment to check in i was ignored | the clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me | thinking room service would be better i relaxed in my room while i waited for my food | by the time it reached my room it was cold and the wrong order | disgusted i went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance | all the restaurants the hotel recommended were one-star and none of my regular channels were on the tv | all in all it was a bad stay at the james hotel in chicago | |be prepared the hotel is old | it is on the historic list | the is updating to be done no doubt | | so just be forewarned | it is clean and the staff is phenomenal | having said that you can not beat the location | right in the heart of the gold coast | take a train from o'hare right into the city | it drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel | one block from the beach and public transportation is right there | incredible area to explore | i highly recommend the ambassador east| |we have just returned from 4 nights at the conrad chicago everthing about the hotel was excellent | wonderful room and service from all the staff was first class | great view from our room | the hotels location is great right in the centre of the magnificent mile | a wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the conrad | |staying at the hard rock hotel is one of best bets you can ever make while traveling | i stayed at this one the last time i visited chicago and it was just wonderful | the rooms are amazing and the one i stayed in had a great view of the city | the beds were comfortable and everything was really clean and neat the wi-fi was really fast and always available and i liked the fact that you could get a guitar at the front desk and jam in your own room with a pair of headphones | i didn't have the chance to use the spa but i could tell it was really nice and relaxing | i did go to the base bar a couple times for a drink very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from | the rock shop was pretty cool too and i bought a bunch of shirts to bring back home to family and friends | overall i think this is one of the coolest hotels you could stay in the experience is definitely different than any other hotel i've stayed in | |the sofitel water tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to chicago | we got married in the city but then moved away and it was so romantic to return | we loved how near the sofitel was to everything - the magnificent mile was just outside our door and we could walk to navy pier and other attractions as well | chicago has changed but the sofitel made it feel like home again | | | except a very plush and elegant version of home | we stayed in a junior suite which had great views of the city and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived | both nights before leaving for supper we had a cocktail in le bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day and all the great memories this town has for us | but i have to say we have some new great memories now thanks to the sofitel water tower | |i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel for a total of three days and through out my stay i had a wonderful time | the room was impeccably clean as well as the pillows and sheets | the beds were large and extremely comfortable | the staff though in my honest opinion is what made my stay so pleasant | from the people at the check in to the waiters at the restaurant i got the best customer service | the hotel was also conveniently located | it was within walking distance to the shopping center | i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in chicago | |hard rock chicago - i had gone to chicago last week to meet some friends | as the purpose of my visit was leisure i had to pick a hotel that was close to downtown and was suited to a young crowd | after some research hard rock seemed to meet both the criteria | i had made reservations two months in advance so got a decent rate of $259 a nightif you book last minute it will definitely be expensive | the decor of the rooms and the hotel was in line with its theme | when i entered the room there was some towels that were thrown on the floor | this did upset me at first but the staff was very accommodating and gave me a new room immediately and also gave me a compensation of $70 | my second room and the bathroom was spacious and clean | there was well stocked mini bar | | |however was very expensive like all good hotels | the room service was very prompt | i didnâŠ™t spend too much time in the room but whatever little i did was all in all a good experience | |great front desk staff the rest of the experience was dreadful | the room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained i have ever encountered | we had to ask four times for the staff not to slam the supply closet adjacent to our room almost in the room itself | they do these random room checks for the minibar as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $9 peanuts | the roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones | if you like sleeping in on your vacation don't stay here | also the hotel was under massive construction a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website | so we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it | no discount because of the work and noise | i'd rather sleep in a box in the alley | |i disliked the sofitel so much we changed our week stay to the grand hyatt after the first night | we checked into our suite and was blasted by the smell of body odor immediately | we were tired from our flight but went downstairs to change rooms | the second suite smelled just as bad but stayed anyway | i disliked the hotel lobby the staff the decorating and especially the bed | horrible | soft flimsy mattress | we come to chicago frequently | we have always stayed at the grand hyatt and never been disappointed | we just thought we'd try some place new | never again | back to the hyatt or four season we go | |palmer house a hilton hotel - the palmer house is a fantastic place to stay in chicago | just by walking through the front door i was treated to the sight of the beautiful architecture of the hotel lobby | the rooms are all very well furnished and what surprised me the most is the amount of floor space in each room | unlike other hotel rooms where everything feels condensed and the room feels crowded with all of the furniture the rooms at the palmer house have a lot of floor space to simply spread out and relax | the beds are all extremely soft and each rooms comes with a large flat panel television | the bathrooms are also amazing | i have stayed at numerous fancy hotels before but never have i encountered a bathroom so spotless | i recommend this hotel one hundred percent | the palmer house has definitely deserved my repeat business | |swissotel - a friend recommended this hotel to me and i decided to give it a try while visiting chicago | for $270 a night the room was better than expected | i ended up with one of those corner rooms so the shape was somewhat awkward but i had no other complaints | the bed was comfy and the bathroom clean | the view wasn't all that exciting but that ended up better as the room was quiet | the staff was nice and i had a pleasant time | will definitely stay again if in chicago | |i was in chicago for a convention and stayed at the sheraton towers | i had a negative experience because i got about one dozen very painful bites by bed bugs on my torso | it made attending the conference uncomfortable | the staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room as the conference had booked the whole hotel | after the sheets were changed i got no more bites thankfully | despite this i managed to enjoy the stay | i liked the location next to the river and the fact that it was easy to walk to magnificent mile | |i decided to book at the amalfi after cancelling a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on ta | i was blown away by the reviews for the amalfi on ta and decided to check it out | i was able to secure a great price on the hotel room and i was not disappointed | i asked to be put in a quiet room because i was having an interview the next day | the room was very quiet and in a great location but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and i could hear people running on the treadmill during the day | however it quieted down at night and i could not hear anything | the rooms were enormous for chicago and i was pleased | | | the hotel provided free breakfast which was good free internet and free gym access | the hotel is only a few blocks from the magnificient mile and i walked there everyday to do shopping | i have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly | i wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was | all in all i plan to stay at the amalfi anytime i visit chicago in the future | |hyattregencychicago - my stay at this hotel was very memorable | while the service was slow at times my stay was overall fantastic | the room was very spacious | we had two massive queen beds and a large bathroom with a full jacuzzi that was large enough to sit three people | both the room and the bathroom had dimmable lights so that we could control the atmosphere of the room | i was also impressed with the hd tv at the center of the room and the automatic shades | the location was great | it's right at the center of downtown chicago and makes for great access to all that chicago has to offer | while we didnâŠ™t try the restaurant at the hotel itself there were many excellent food options nearby | iâŠ™d highly recommend bistro 110 which has an excellent steak and is within walking distance of the hotel | iâŠ™d definitely suggest you consider this hotel next time you take your family to chicago | |our vacation was highlighted by a four day stay at homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown |i believed it would be the best part of the trip i discovered it was an unfolding nightmare | while in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor a voice emanating from the phone informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow | anyone above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed door |do not use the elevators and wait for further instructions |we nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phone |we then decided to exit via the stairs realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells doors behind you were locked |we continued to travel downward against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers |obviously we were rescued without any physical injuries yet emotionally we were damaged |i now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less | |we stayed at the james hotel for a 40th birthday | the location was excellent for shopping and restaurants but also very loud | the room was horrible | very small | we had a double/double and it was the size of a college dorm room plus completely white walls and linens | absolutely no color except for one accent pillow | it was very sterile and uninviting | we were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting | it looked like the entrance to hell if not a haunted house | staff was very nice and accomodating | i would not return to this hotel | |any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth eventually the lodging deteriorates | but you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time | i have been staying at the talbott for several decades | yes changes have been made like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance most recently | but other things have gone downhill | for the last several stays i have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service | rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions | this is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of the talbott but not this less-than-maintained lodging | i personally am shopping for a new home away from home | |i was an intern at boeing's chicago office and got placed in this hotel for a while since there was no more corporate housing in the city | it was really awesome staying in a hilton for almost a month | the breakfast bar was huge | i was dissapointed that there was no oven in my room so i couldn't prepare anything | but the decor was really nice and the bed was incredibly fluffy | |we stayed at this hotel for a conference | the lobby and the conference areas were immaculate | the restaurants one of which was shula's steakhouse and bars were great | the saff was exteremely helpful | the rooms left a lot to be desired | | |our nonsmoking room smelled of smoke | the a/c system was ancient and tempermental and the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover | it was surprising to see since the physical plant was so nice | we would choose however to stay elsewhere | espcially for the money we paid | |amalfi hotel chicago - the website makes it look better than it actually is | don't get fooled by the pictures the rooms are small and dark | we paid $300 for a corner room with a view and all we could see were buildings and dumpsters | beautiful | also i think there was some mold in our bathroom around the base of the tub | there are many other great hotels in chicago hotel sax the palmer house hilton i will not be returning here | |i stayed there on october 6 2012 | when i pulled the covers of my bed there was a small dark brown insect the size of a grain of rice which was either a bed bug or cockroach | i trapped it under a glass see the attached pictures and called the front desk | the housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach | absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem failing to follow through on promises they made to me | setting aside the bug problem i caution that the windows are quite thin | we could hear a lot of the street noise which made for a hard night's sleep not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms | for $400 a night after tax i strongly encourage you to check for alternatives | |conrad chicago - while i have been impressed with other branches of this hotel this one is lacking in many areas | the front staff was somewhat incompetent | the rooms were tidy and cleaning was not up to the mark the tv was non operational shower arm was rusty and the breakfast service was slow | given this is a 4 |5 star hotel it really didn't live up to the expectations | the only good part was that the hotel was in the middle of great sight seeing locations | anyway definitely would not recommend anyone staying here considering there are many other good hotels around this area | |the amalfi hotel chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay | when arriving at the hotel my party and i had over a 20 minute wait just to check in | we were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their private counter that their website highlights | it felt as though i was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in | not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever but our reservations were completely wrong | i ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when i had reserved a smoking king room | not having the room i requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel | i was not compensated for having to switch rooms and audrey our experience designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze | i recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area | the amalfi hotel chicago is a waste of time and money as far as i am concerned especially when i could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort | don't waist your time staying here | |palmer house a hilton hotel - i stayed at the palmer house on march 16th when i was in town for a business trip | i was very impressed with the hotel overall | i really liked how elegant the lobby was | was very impressed with he staff because they called and checked on me when i missed check in due to a flight delay | |great hotel in heart of chicago for business or pleasure | rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large | flat screen tvs marble baths all rooms are suites great desk kitchenette comfortable bed free wireless internet | | | everything you could ask for | location is easy walk to magnificient mile and lots of great restaurants | staff is friendly and helpful | short cab ride to loop | |we absolutely loved the knickerbocker | now if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable forget this place | if holiday inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs the knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city | the location is great the hotel bar is cozy and classy and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in victorian mansions | for the price you simply can't do any better than this in downtown chicago | |we stay at hilton for 4 nights last march | it was a pleasant stay | we got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms the tv was ok a 27' crt flat screen | the coincierge was very friendly when we need | the room was very cleaned when we arrived we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was ok also |the main hall is beautiful | the breakfast is charged 20 dollars kinda expensive | the internet access wifi is charged 13 dollars/day | pros low rate price huge rooms close to attractions at loop close to metro station | cons expensive breakfast internet access charged | tip when leaving the building always use the michigan av exit | its a great view | |my stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was by far the worst hotel stay i ever had | i would not recommend this hotel to anyone | they promised i would be able to relax in the spa area and it was dirty and not relaxing at all | when i got to my room i ordered room service and it took them 45 minutes to bring what i ordered | i am highly dissatisfied | |my stay at the palmer house hilton was wonderful | i was attracted to this hotel because it was going to be me and my finance's first time in chicago | the location of the hotel was perfectly placed downtown chicago we took advantage of the hilton bed and breakfast special | upon check in on friday afternoon we went to the lockwood restaurant before going to the room for the weekend | we stayed in a one bedroom suite with a king size bed | the hotel was spotless | i have never been in a hotel room that was so clean | the portions of food was perfect and everything they provided was on point | i would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to visit chicago for the first time | the staff is professional and let you feel like a king and queen | |sofitel chicago water tower - our stay at sofitel was ok at best | the room was well furnished but small and the bathroom felt a little cramped as well | and the bed was almost uncomfortable | i liked the location a lot as it was convenient but for the money we paid we really expected more | overall would not recommend | you are better off spending your money somewhere else | |we have stayed here several times and have always found it to be clean with comfortable beds | we were given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which we thought was a nice touch | our room was small but adequate | location was great close to the l trains and also close to the train station as we always walk from union station | |james - if you especially love testing your patience then wait no longer this hotel is the one for you | i particularly enjoyed the lack of service | i ordered a filet mignon and it took them 2 hours to call me back and tell me that they are out of filet mignon | so then i ordered their salmon it was cold on the inside and it took another hour before i could enjoy my dinner | i got to admit the room is actually pretty nice but it would have been nicer if i got paid by the hotel for being my own housekeeper | the housekeeping never showed that one night and it makes me wonder if all the other 5 star reviews are actually fake | after a night of distress i wanted to enjoy a bubble bath | i am a sucker for a nice bubble bath so i was going to forgive them after my bath but to my great surprise i wasn't able to enjoy one | water kept on leaking out of the tub and down to the drain even after trying hard to fit in the bath plug in many different orientations | this hotel has a very special place in my heart when someone i loathe asks me for a recommendation this hotel will never fail to disappoint | |stayed at the fitzpatrick before about 4 years ago it was ok | the management was great staff was so kind and rooms were clean | ** but this time i promised my self never to go back | | the new staff was so rude | | i made a reservation for my anniversary on the internet and the day of check in i was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation |** 1 i was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline | 2 staff was extremely rude | not arrogant but rude | like they hated thier job | 3 they offered check in at 1pm but the room wasn't ready till 3pm | 4 there were stains everywhere | 5 because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff | |my stay at sheraton chicago hotel and towers was wonderful i stayed in the traditional guest room and i slept good i was able to get to my meeting well rested thank you sheraton | -bobby| |when you stay at a hotel like the james just from their price point you expect a certain level of quality | if i pay well over 500 dollars for a room i do not think it unreasonable to expect not only a quality room but also a certain level of standard of service | perhaps this hotel should rename itself the lebron james because it has about as much class as he does and is about twice as pretentious | a handful of baby powder thrown into my face would have been a refreshing break from the level of service i received at the lebron james | my night of hell began with the clerk bellboy or whatever he was at the front desk who faked what i assume was intended to be a british accent but ended up as an unholy melding of australian and new englander | a british accent does not make you fancy or skilled | once i made my way past mr | belvedere and to my room i was disappointed not only by its size which was unusually small but also a faint scent of cigarettes | not a strong one but i could definitely smell smoke | not acceptable | then while i was sleeping a deep throbbing sound began to emanate from the walls | it sounded technical mechanical like an air conditiner malfunctioning | despite many reassurances from the front desk the throbbing continued on throughout the night | i demanded the man at the front desk come up and rectify the situation immediately but from what i could tell he never came | |my wife and i just returned from a 3 night stay at the amalfi hotel in chicago and enjoyed everything about the hotel | most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space great jazz cd's in the room wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in | the staff was very helpful with every request | the amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry's fruit's and jucie's | we also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta's for their guests | would highly recommend this hotel | |me and my wife recently stayed at the hilton chicago while on vacation and i can't recommend it enough | the hotel is located right on michigan avenue in downtown chicago and right next to tons of great restaurants and stores | the rooms are spacious and elegant they are modern and stylish without being crazy or garish | i especially liked the big flat screen tv and the very comfy bed sleeping in hotel rooms is often far from relaxing but i had no problem falling asleep | i highly recommend the hilton chicago i'll definitely stay there again | a+| |our trip to chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the affinia hotel | because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in new york city we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment | we could not have been more wrong | this place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition | uunfortunately it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way | both the dream pillow menu and the experience kit were a complete flop | with the dream pillow menu the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections | we happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out | at first i thought it was my imagination so i stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed | more dust came out them | particles were flying around the room i'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand | i called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows | these pillows were some kind of music pillow that pluged into an mp3 player | i was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night | in general the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows | another failed gimmick they offered was the experience kits | we were given ours to keep a collection of some maps which were actually very nice a walking tour guide that was all marked up and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards | if this place lacked attention to detail that is one thing but it lacked any attention at all | if the pillows weren't already enough at this point i was certain that i would never stay at this establishment again | run don't walk away from this place | |booked via priceline |com for a weekend getaway and got the room for $75 per night | when we arrived via midway we took the orange line to within a block of the hotel for just $2 | hotel easy to find | never felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood/area | saw very few homeless or panhandlers | walked all over the place | great location and hotel is about a $5-$6 cab ride from most major attractions/shopping/restaurants | hotel is almost gawdy with colors/decor but it's not that different from a cruise ship decor | it was not annoying decor by any means | check in was painless and the service was great | heard no noise whatsoever | | |the reports of thin walls are greatly exaggerated | the walls are all concrete and thick | | |we heard nothing both nights we were there | highly recommend this hotel | rooms are small but not crowded for two people | | |they are old style hotel rooms | |very classic| |hard rock hotel - i don't really listen to rock music but my friend suggested that i stay at the hard rock hotel and i have no regrets | the configuration of the room is like any other hotel but with some added rock and roll flavor | there was a beatles picture in the bathroom and gene simmons was embedded in the mirror | the view is amazing and the hotel is located in the middle of downtown chicago so its close to anything you would want to do | i do have one complaint the walls are thin and things can get kind of noisy | | |but i guess that's to be expected when you stay at a hotel that revolves around music | |my stay at the ambassador east was great | the hotel is in a great location in the charming gold coast neighborhood of downtown chicago | gave me the feeling of staying in a chicago neighborhood vs | the concrete jungle of downtown but the magnificent mile and rush street are just a few blocks from the front door | the staff was very friendly | also really enjoyed having drinks in the historic pump room | they had a live band on saturday and i really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the celebrities throughout the lounge that visited from years gone by | definitely recommend it | |going to the internet retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services | first of all from reading other reviews now i know i got ripped  $249 a night when priceline folks are sniping these rooms for $79 albiet i got free wifi | the hotel is nice but it can only get so nice for an oldie | | |no matter how much money you dump into it | shower head was really low i'm 6'1 water pressure was low | it is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by check out reviews on yelp | for some off reason i ended up with two double beds they asked me a few times if i was traveling alone | if traveling here 1 - make sure you get a better deal than i did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - don't have super high hopes my room was neither up to par as a business class although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple | | |it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers sp | trying to save money | |my daughter wanted to spend the weekend in chicago for her 21st birthday recently and i wanted to find the best hotel for her experience | i looked at the hotel website and really like hotel allegro's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services so i booked us for a friday and saturday night | upon arriving the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant | not enough to warrant a verbal complaint but enough to make my daughter and i feel uneasy | after check-in which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing we headed to our room trying to be optimistic | our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound and we only had a stock of 2 towels which were never replaced during our stay | we made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel | it was a huge disappointment for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl | i highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel | there are much better choices in the chicago area | |we visited for my 40th birthday | we had never been to chicago so was not sure where to stay | found the deal on this hotel from travelzoo | great rate staff was awesome very helpful and nice location was great | enjoyed our stay but still like nyc better | great great hotel | would stay again | |it is always interesting going to a high quality hotel | i cannot help but think about the service and the value | maybe i have too high expectations | certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great | but the room was not well cleaned a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that i left in the room | the hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service | i noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel | i know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this | overall chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not | stay else where | |hard rock hotel - the hard rock is incredible probably the best hotel i've ever stayed in | the concierge was amazing they gave me a complimentary upgrade to a 'platinum king' room from the standard room reservation that i had made right when i arrived | the room was huge and featured a beautiful king size bed right in the middle | there was a great big office desk off in the corner of the room and a very comfortable chair along with it -  perfect for the little bit of work i brought with me | the bathroom though was incredible | the sink vanity was huge the sink itself was deeper than my bathroom sink at home and the shower easily fit two people | i'd highly recommend staying here if you get the chance i know i'll be back | |i stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in september for a pleasure trip -- the intercontinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent | the room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new lg flat panel tv | had breakfast at zest hotel restaurant -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet | the hotel is in walking distance to millenium park museums and the aquarium | there is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though considering the sales tax is 9 |5% | and possibly raising to 11% great stay | i highly recommend it and would stay there again | |allegro - i stayed in the allegro hotel in december/january when i visited chicago for the new year celebrations | my stay was absolutely pleasant | we were served a welcome drink and greeted right at the reception and the christmas decoration in the lobby was amazing | we stayed in the king suite of the hotel and it was very charming | they had made a swan from towels on the bed which was very innovative | the room was immaculate | the jacuzzi was a splendid experience and was very spacious | the 37’’ inch flat screen television in the room made it very difficult to leave the room | there was a minor incident when they brought the wrong order when i ordered food but they totally made up for it by not charging for that whole meal | |i decided to spend the extra money booking a room at the monaco because of the website's pictures of the beautiful rooms and views | it was a waste of cash to say the least | although i had requested a room with a view of the city they must have given me the worst room in the place | maid service skipped over my room on my second day there and i had to call for towels at least twice before someone finally came to my room | the food was outrageously expensive and not even lukewarm | two-star hotel quality | |stayed here for 5 nights while visiting chicago for the first time | the location is great the hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very spacious with two bathrooms | the lobby is a great place to chill and have a drink | didn't eat in the restaurant but there are a few good ones nearby and we were beside the art institute cultural centre & macys | staff were friendly | would recommend it as a base to tour the city | |this is a great hotel | the views are fabulous the service it friendly and the location is superb | we booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the chicago river | the only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped | we booked our room for $89 a night for memorial day weekend | it was a steal | i highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning | |i was going to chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops | i did some research and believed the intercontinental would suit my needs | i sure was not disappointed by my decision | this hotel lots of historic charm | despite being a larger hotel the service was top shelf | the rooms while not large by any means were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable | my kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered | as for me i was more impressed with the location to the magnificent mile | the hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site | the food was very good and just like the hotel itself the restaurant provided perfect customer service | dollar for dollar the intercontinental in chicago is a great deal and i will be staying there again | |we just arrived from a 3 nights stay at the sofitel chicago water tower | it was faboulous | fine linen nice room with bigs windows bathroom with a shower flat tv | check for the deals on the sofitel website we had 3 nights for the price of two  | |we stayed at the swissotel for a special birthday weekend for my wife from aug 25 to 29 | i had called ahead to ask for a nice room and to order flowers for my wife | jaymes ballard the concierge made arrange for flowers early check-in and we had a great room | our room was the 33rd floor with a view facing the city | room was large everything looked like new great bed large bathroom with separate shower great ammenities | a beautiful bouquet of flowers arrived upon our arrival | the hotel is about 10 mins from everything not close but not far from anything | has a great restaurant 2 patios outside where i had a cigar | a really nice pool and hot tub on the 42nd floor | i would recommend this hotel to anyone and thanks to jaymes for making our trip very special | |sofitel chicago water tower – i stayed at sofitel chicago water tower for a weekend last may | this hotel was absolutely wonderful | check-in was quick and the girl at the reception was very nice and helpful in responding to my questions about nearby restaurants | the location of the hotel is excellent right at the magnificent miles and in the middle of many boutiques which let me do a lot of shopping | the hotel is also very quiet and nice | my room was on the top of the building so i got a very nice view of the chicago downtown | the room service was very satisfiable the night i arrived the hotel it was quite late but when i ordered a meal my call was answered politely and my order came very quickly | there was a nice lcd tv in the room so i could enjoy some night shows in the hotel as well | in the mornings the provided breakfast was buffet-style and there were plenty of selections | i slept very well on all nights so i was always full of energy during the daytime to tour the city | i will stay in this hotel again the next time i come to chicago | |we stayed in the ic chicago for 6 nights from 26th dec after reading the reviews on trip advisor | we werent disappointed | we had 2 rooms opposite each other in the historic tower | the rooms were spacious and very clean with good views towards the river and tribune building | we got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the wifi at $17 per day | as the hotel is on the magnificent mile there are plenty of place to eat including for breakfast | the starbucks in the lobby was a hit with the kids - very handy | i would definitely recommend the hotel | |my family really enjoyed this hotel the weekend we were in chicago | check in was quick and easy the staff was friendly and very helpful | the room was clean the beds were comfortable and we had a great view of chicago | next time we come to chicago we will definitely stay here again | |the chicago hyatt regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation--ie the room cannot be cancelled | i recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel | the reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72-hour cancellation policy | however when i tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe robert the reservation supervisor said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room | he said that i should refer to the confirmation e-mail that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking / non-refunable | this clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone | i told him to cancel without being charged | in response he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay | why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price | the bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement and robert should go back to customer service school | |my wife and i spent our honeymoon in chicago this summer | during this time we stayed that the hotel allegro | i knew this would be a positive experience from day one when i actually booked our reservations the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous and the whole process was quick easy and painless | upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease | the rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent | five stars and two thumbs up | |if you're looking for an elegant hotel in downtown chicago you have to stay here | the ambassador east hotel has very comfortable and beautiful large rooms and is like a home away from home | the perfect place for a business person and if you have a small pet you can bring them too | i would give this place four stars and would definitely stay here again | |first let me say wonderful | | my wife and i were refered this hotel by a friend | after traveling to chicago many time we have had many experiences good and bad with different hotels | we were amazed with the knickerbocker we felt like royalty from our first step on the property | everyone was willing to make our stay rememberable | this hotel made a routine trip to chicago a dream vacation | i can not wait to return | | | |when my husband and i went to amalfi hotel we were expecting first class service | first when we got there we learned they had given our room to another guest and we were not able to get a suite like we had booked | room service took forever and the food was subpar | supposedly they had planners to help explore the area but we requested one and never saw hide nor hair of a planner | the spa staff seemed incompetent | the only positive things i can say about amalfi hotel was that the rooms were stylish as advertised | i give this hotel two stars | |the hotel allegro in chicago is understated luxury | i love the minimalist decor and the linens were quality and exquisite | you can't beat the location either it's located in the heart of the theatre district | walking distance to all the great restaurants in chicago | they also offer an in-room spa service which is pure decadence | i chose to indulge in the eucalyptus mani/pedi | it was by far the priciest manicure and pedicure i have had in my life 135 dollars but it was a wonderful experience | the eucalyptus treatments left my hands and feet feeling so soft yet refreshed at the same time | i highly recommend this hotel if you want to experience the finer thingsthis gorgeous city has to offer | |i was very disappointed with this hotel | the front desk clerk was rude she was on a personal call and took 10 mins | to get off the phone | when i arrived in the room the bed wasn't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty | i called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignmenton the twelveth floor | once downstairs the clerk treated me as though i had done something wrong | when i arrived in the new room i found the bathroom less than clean | | | there was hair all over the floor toilet and shower | the shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror | my allergies started to bother me immediately upon entering the room so i checked the filter in the air conditioner | which looked like it had never been cleaned |the comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum | while waiting on acceptable room i went to dinner | which proved to be as bad as the rooms | the lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy | the steak was rare and i asked for medium | not to mention it tasted like rotten meat |the veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry | to top the whole experience off | | | when i went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay | |i was really excited to be visiting chicago for the first time and the hotel that was recommended to me was the conrad chicago located on rush street | i wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites and the conrad chicago does not disappoint in that respect | however everything else about this hotel could be classified as sub-par ranging from the rudeness of the check-in clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room | this hotel does not deserve to be on anyone's recommended list | my first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in | after asking for three forms of identification most places only ask for a driver's license and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to chicago she reluctantly gave me a room key | i asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if i wanted to wait one would be able to help in about 15 minutes | i didn't feel like waiting so i dragged my bags to the room only to find that the room key did not work | instead of dragging everything back down i decided to use my cell phone to call the front desk only there was no cell phone signal in the hall way | i couldn't believe i was in the middle of downtown chicago and the hotel did not have a signal | i finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room but i immediately saw there were problems | two roaches scampered across the carpet and when i went into the bathroom there were no towels or wash cloths | i went to turn on the tv and it didn't work | one of the lamps was missing a light bulb | i couldn't believe that this was happening to me | i was at the conrad chicago not the motel six | i then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy | i was ready to cry | i was spending a lot of money on this hotel and it was a dump | i called down to the front desk and asked for another room but they refused saying i had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes | i insisted that they give me towels fix the tv put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches | they agreed but told me it would take awhile because several of their key personnel had called in sick | my stay at the conrad chicago was a nightmare from beginning to end | i would not recommend this hotel to anyone| |my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel last month for my son's wedding | when we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to valet our car | after waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip which i found rude | after finally getting to our room i noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom | i was extremely disappointed with the room and the service | i will not recommend this place to anyone | |my husband and i stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it | it is so conveniently located close to navy pier and michigan ave | the staff was very helpful and the room was great | it was definitely worth every penny | i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago | |i stayed for four nights while attending a conference | the hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to michigan ave shopping or rush st | but just off the busy streets | the room i had was spacious and very well-appointed | the staff was friendly and the fitness center while not huge was well-equipped and clean | i've stayed at a number of hotels in chicago and this one is my favorite | internet wasn't free but at $10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels and it worked very well | |we wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner theater and my daughter's 21st birthday | this place certainly fit the bill | it was convenient to everything including the southshore railroad station | the staff were all friendly | their was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and starbucks coffee in the morning | ryan the concierge ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of hershey kisses waiting for us when we arrived | we were upgraded to a suite and although they forgot to make up the sofa bed they came promptly to get it set up when we called later | the window seats were beautiful as well and i enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning and reading a book | |we stayed for a one night getaway with family on a thursday | triple aaa rate of 173 was a steal | 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma tv bose stereo voss and evian water and gorgeous bathroomno tub but was fine for us concierge was very helpful | you cannot beat this location | | | only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant | food was very good so it was worth the wait | i would return in a heartbeat | a gem in chicago | | | |we booked our stay through priceline |com and got a great deal | we were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us | at check-in we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of lake michigan | it was beautiful | the suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini-fridge which we didn't need but if we were staying longer it would have been a godsend | this hotel is in close proximity with grant park which has the beautiful buckingham fountain | we walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed | | | |but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it this isn't the one | we ended up eating at the irish pub inside the hotel kitty o'shea's which has great food | we have stayed here before and always end up eating here | there are a lot of attractions within a mile including the field museum shedd aquarium soldier field and navy pier | they may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window | overall we had another wonderful stay at the chicago hilton | our 4th stay the only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel | | | | |41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous | |i think the sofitel chicago water tower is a upscale place |i had my wedding there and it was the best of the best |the staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success | the chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts |they also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake |the tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect |the bar was also set up the way i wanted it and even had a champagne fountain | my guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered |the rooms were like suites with a mini bar |they had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom | if you are looking to have a wedding in the chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed | |i went to chicago and we made a reservation to hotel monaco chicago which is a kimpton hotel and i decided to stay in a tranquility suite | which was amazing i went with my family and all of us had a comfortable space | room service was great served quickly and the cleaners clean quick | another thing was that it was pet friendly which i thought was cool meaning you could bring your dogs | the hotel was amazing and beutiful | |palmer house a hilton hotel – me and my family visited chicago last month and we had decided to stay at the palmer house after reading the online reviews | we stayed in a guest room with two double beds | the room was big and spacious the bed and the bed sheets were soft and comfortable | the bathrooms were also clean and all the necessary amenities were available for us to enjoy | the dining at the hotel – the lockwood was very exotic and had a wonderful ambience but we did not like the food they served | we preferred trying out various places like the alinea and the odyssey which we felt were much better | overall palmer house is a wonderful place to stay in chicago except that we would suggest trying out other places around to dine rather than depending only on their own dining places | |the fairmount chigaco-i stayed the fairmount chicago for my sister's wedding over memorial day weekend and it was wonderful | the rooms were quite spacious and had a beautiful view of the river and the city skyline | the hotel is close to the magnificent mile so i could get all my shopping in | the best part is the fairmont helped me arrange for child-care for my 3-year-old son who would have been quite disruptive to the ceremony | next time i stay in chicago i'll be staying at the fairmont | |excellent hotel in the heart of chicago | the room we stayed in had a great view of lake michigan | we went in july for a vacation and everything is easily accesible from the hotel | most major attractions are in around the loop area | we also got a great deal on the price | i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago - its in the right spot for both business and pleasure | |fairmont - i stayed at the fairmont for a couple of days | it was a bad experience which started with a long wait for check in | the unfriendly behavior of the staff did not make things better | i got the room on the tenth floor | though the room had a good view the room and bathroom were too small in size and definitely not worth the money | the bathroom was not as clean as expected | the sushi in the sushi club is over hyped | i would recommend against staying at this hotel | |i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that i ever had | one of the main reasons why i had originally booked my stay at the fairmont was because the property offered special pure rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic | because i suffer from extreme allergies -- and i really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- i was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities | i'll tell you this right now -- save your money | when i got to my room i immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold | to add to the gross factor i took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet | the comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it | there was no way i was going to stay in this room so i made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room | the woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer | after making me wait for another twenty minutes she finally informed me that they could put me in another room but it would be a four hour wait | four hours | it was absolutely ridiculous | no hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way | i do not recommend the fairmont nor will i ever stay there again | |i recently stayed at the swissotel chicago with my husband and two children | while the room was comfortable i did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children | the main reason for this was the dining | while the in house restaurants had children's options there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal | anyone with children knows that you don't want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times | this was especially true since we were traveling | we arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed | however our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants | this was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package | |i first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the affinia chicago hotel where i'm greeted by name by the concierge | he tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when i booked the stay | he shows me to my room paying careful attention to my bags and ensuring that i needn't lift a finger sure enough the down pillow i had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didn't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed | i notice that there's a display of champagne and cupcakes  | atop the dresser and my experience kit which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks and a yoga mat | namaste | unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom i find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower but a jacuzzi lined with candles of vanilla deep enough to bathe a walrus | feeling girlish i run the water and test before going to dinner | the hotel's restraunt c-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you're dining with the kings of paradise | or at least eating in the caribbean itself | hmm i should have brought a date | |i actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price | it was a lovely hotel beautifully appointed walking distance from the places we wanted to go | we would highly recommend the fairmont | |the hard rock hotel chicago has become my favorite hotel | i've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience | as you might have guessed - it has a super rock & roll theme with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor's elevator lobby | the rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians | you can request being on the floor of your favorite band like kiss aerosmith etc | | | the rooms are great | well appointed | super comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows | the large tv has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience | there's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar | i've always had a room with big windows and a view down michigan ave the hotel sits right on michigan - a block from the canal | the bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design | | | some of the showers have windows in side of them you can shower and enjoy the view down michigan | or close the waterproof drapes | i've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here | | | front desk doorman etc are all great | there's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy | big screen tv to catch the latest scores too | of course rock & roll music pumps thru the place | you can stay at a plain hotel anywhere | | | but this is a great well designed fun and memorable hotel that you'll want to return back to | if i had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight | my daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night which i'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop | stay here | be cool | |my wife and i recently stayed at the allegro hotel in chicago and were extremely disappointed | it claims to be a luxury hotel but the air conditioning in our unit wasn't working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow | we phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of | noone ever showed up | aside from that there were so many kids running around we couldn't think straight | this is just my two cents but i'd would tell anyone considering staying at the allegro to pass and look at their other options | |we had a reservation for 3 rooms with 5 adults and 2 kids got only 2 rooms on arrival | 2 of the corner rooms with an extra room | during the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the a |c | even though we switched it off it went on cooling strange | at night it was very loud from the street | in the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and i stood vertically in the bed not what you need if you only spend 1 night in a hotel | we came here a few years ago and had it better in mind | the area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places very good | clean and fancy | sorry but next time we`ll be looking for a more quiet hotel in chicago | |swissotel chicago - it was not really worth it | the room was small and cluttered and the shower in the bathroom was way too cramped | overall the room was fine but it just seemed old | also my family and i ate at the palm and the food was not very fresh and not very well prepared | overall i can't say this hotel was a great choice there are many others to choose from in the downtown area | |i was initially very excited to be staying at the ambassador east hotel | the photos online appeared very classy and upscale and i thought staying there would be a pleasant experience | upon arrival i was very disappointed - the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around | our room was very dated - old furnishings and linens damaged tile - it fell quite short for the high price we paid | it is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning | doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room - gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel | |i stayed at the chicago fairmont for four nights for a conference | my fiance' accompanied me | when we checked in we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed | so instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like ward and june cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house | we discovered that the coffee maker wasn't working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it and waited two and half hours | we had issues with the plumbing including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill | the toilet stopped working twice | we returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room sitting on the bed watching the tv and talking on her cell phone | they bellman were rude and wouldn't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment | there were errors on our bill | last but not least we saw a roach in the drawers | alive | the restaurant downstairs was decent and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better | i will never ever stay here again under any circumstances | |chicago is my favorite city visit | i wanted to share this special city with a new love and booked us a room at the swissotel | it is advertised as close to downtown and close to the museums of chicago | i wanted to share my new love | it was indeed close to the museums but to get to either the shopping district or the chicago art institute it was a long walk full of detours and it was not easy to grab a cab | while the rooms seemed to be luxuriously decorated the beds were uncomfortable and the rooms just were not very clean | the room service was slow the food arrived cold and the total experience was way so expensive for what we got | i do not think i have ever experienced the level of noise in such a grand hotel as the swissotel seems | i would not recommend the swissotel because disappointment noise and cold food should just not cost that much | |months prior to my 5-night reservation with the hilton chicago i requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light facing an open view not a close building | the reservation was made through a conference travel agency | i confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record | she told me it would be difficult to find but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me | i was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers tucked into a very dark corner facing a wall of rooms | i called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request but to sit tight and someone would call me | no one did | further calls yielded similar results | at one point i was told i could have a parlor room with a sofa bed at a reduced rate but i could not go see the room before committing to moving | that's real hospitality for you | worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave i ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room | i had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds | the only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms | other than that it was tight quarters with a tiny closet two uncomfortably low chairs at the desk and in a dark corner | light fixtures didn't do much to brighten things up | since i was here at a conference i really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail but instead i got a cave | consequently i spent as little time as possible in the room and next time i am in chicago conference or not i will absolutely stay at another hotel | there are much better locations that the hilton chicago and looking at the percentage of inside tower rooms places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service | shame on the chicago hilton | |this is a beautiful hotel inside and outside | the rooms were very comfortable and clean | the hotel made my experience of visiting this city even more wonderful i highly recommend this to anyone | |i have never experienced terrible service like this especially at such a highly rated hotel | i had booked the hotel room for my parents for their anniversary weekend and stopped by earlier in the week to have the charge for the room put on my card as a gift | when my parents arrived they were told that the front desk staff was new and did not complete the charge correctly | my parents then had to charge their own anniversary trip | additionally my father had requested a non-smoking room to stay in and was reassured 3 times that his room was non-smoking | when my parents got to the room it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches on the desk tabletop | when my father caled down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my dad wanted him to come up and remove the ashtray and matches - something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was non-smoking | never again | |i stayed at the hotel one night | the hotel is excellent comparable quality than marriott and sheraton perhaps superior but the location is definitely much better | whatever your trip purpose is business or leisure you can drop your bags and take a walk on the magnificent mile | loved it | |i stayed here for about a week during a conference and the service was excellent | in addition to the excellent service the location was great | with quick access to michigan ave | | the bars and shula's restaurant were excellent | you must have the rib-eye steak | | |very well done | |didn't get the room we were promised | kind of room we had reserved 2 queens wasn't available | they then squeezed 3 adult ladies into 2 singles and a blow-up bed | had to pile furniture on top of tables to get it in | very unsatisfactory | | will not return will not recommend | will tell people going to chicago to not stay in your hotel | when i next visit paris nextspring i intend to stop at your world headquarters to tell them what i think of the chicago facility | |i loved the ambassador | what a great hotel | it's really beautiful and the room was absolutely striking very classic and elegant | everything was done really well the staff treated me like a regular | this is a top-notch hotel the best place i've stayed in a long time | my only complaint is that i wish it was on the mile but that's it | |the location is amazing right across from nordstrom's on michigan avenue | the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean | but | | | we are intercontinental ambassadors the rewards club and to get to the ambassador suite level we have to ride a private express elevator | the elevator took three minutes to get to the thirtieth floor | when we checked in the person behind the counter was rude and acted as if we were lucky to get checked-in | also there was a language barrier becuase she was russian | the pool and spa were both beautiful but we had to pay an extra fee because of upkeep | if you want a nice hotel all the way around | | |go to the omni | |my wife & i celebrated our anniversary at the knickerbocker & could not have been treated better | before we were out of our cab our bags had been loaded on a cart & we were walked into the hotel by a doorman | the rooms were well appointed & the entire hotel staff was very friendly | this is a prime location for shopping sightseeing or nightlife | |my parents booked five nights at the james for its location and good reviews | they had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff | they sent engineers three times to repair the unit and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty | at my parents' request the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort | the hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room | don't book this hotel in the summer | and by the way there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings | |the knickerbocker hotel is fantastic | it's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the old-timey charm and fresh comfort all at once | the hotel has a fabulous location | it's a one minute walk to the cheesecake factory and bloomingdales and about a 5 minute walk to einstein bagel company the best bagels and cream cheese ever macys and saks | this location can't be beat | you're at one end of the magnificent mile so it makes for easy strolling as you don't start in the middle and then backtrack | the hotel staff are super helpful and friendly | checking in and out was very smooth and the concierge cheryl was amazing | she booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us and recommended an incredible restaurant called carmines which was a 5 minute walk | it was the greatest italian restaurant i have ever been to and i can't recommend it more | the rooms are small but not too small | we had a beautiful big samsung flat screen cordless phones a rain shower ample clean towels and beautiful marble countertops | the hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like i was at a 5 star hotel in europe | the beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter | the only complaint i had was that housekeeping woke us up at 830 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on | when we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed | the issue was corrected though and it didn't happen again during our 4 night stay | the hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping | very cute | their late night menu however is lacking | it would have been nice to see some soup on there | that being said i rarely order from room service when on vacation so i really don't see that being a big deal | overall i would recommend this hotel without hesitation | i think we paid about 130 a night and i would say it was worth far more than that | we had a wonderful experience and i truly look forward to staying there again | | | |wouldn't stay anywhere else | |the fairmont chicago millenium park hotel provides a rich beautiful cultured atmosphere | during my stay i felt like royalty | with unparalleled design schemes and beautiful tranquil views the mood during my entire stay was one of bliss | the guest services department was second-to-none | the staff throughout the hotel were obviously concerned with pleasing the customer and making my stay as wonderful as possible | when dealing with a staff member at fairmont i felt as if i were the only guest in the place | the food and drink selections were vast and fit for a king | i will definitely recommend fairmont chicago millenium park to my friends and colleagues | i will also greatly look forward to my next stay | |we experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the omni chicago hotel on the magnificent mile | we never received a return call from general manager sanjay mahajan after several voicemails | we will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word | we also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel | |my husband and i recently spent 3 nights at the ambassador east hotel | we will never stay at this hotel again | for the steep price we paid to stay there we expected a friendly staff and clean room which we did not get | first of all the rooms are not clean | we found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed | when we reported this information to the hotel staff they did not do anything to help us out | the staff is very unfriendly | also there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom | |i had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance yet was given a room facing the street from which i could hear traffic noise | i asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day | the next morning prior to being moved to a quiet room the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood | about an hour later i was moved to a room which did not face the street | the room was quiet but smaller and darker | the mattresses in each room were very firm i would even say hard | i asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same | at checkout i tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside with other passengers | the cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later | as recompense for the noise flood etc | the hotel offered exactly nothing | not a great stay | |james chicago - i stayed at the james chicago last month when i flew into chicago as a getaway from school for spring break | though the hotel is supposed to be âŠœluxury liberatedâŠ there is no liberation whatsoever i tell you | first of all its for people in luxury | though the hotel looks pretty affordable from what they display on the site and a few of the reviews i read it is very expensive | from valet parking to internet - everything is charged extra | the lights in the rooms were incandescent and hurt my eyes a lot | the food at the restaurant was as if they served dishes cooked a week back | the hotel staff were snobby and i was definitely not treated well | from the day i checked in i was so uneasy that i was glad to check out and get outta there | but for the beautiful view from the 10th floor where my room was my experience was something iâŠ™d put behind me | |i stayed at the james in june and i must say it felt like i was in some ultra-swanky boutqiue hotel | from the uniforms of the staff | | which consists of a small j pin that they wear with nice suits and such to the wonderful comfortable beds the james just makes you feel ultra-relaxed | the gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition | i really enjoyed the complimentary kiehl's products as well as the soft cushy beds with futons | location-wise it's just off michigan ave and it's close to all the shops and restaurants | i'd definitely stay here if i'm' ever back in chicago | |i stay in chicago all the time on business and had my first stay at the chicago hilton | i pretty much only stay at hilton properties and have stayed at tons from hawaii all the way to budapest | this hilton is not up to par | it's clean and the front desk staff is nice but in chicago the drake doubletree guest suites and even the hilton garden inn are all superior to the chicago hilton and less expensive | compared to other hilton properties in chicago the rooms were not as well appointed the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice the tv was tiny the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long and the breakfast you get was more like a hampton inn than a 4 star hotel | if you're going to chicago and you like hilton brand hotels you can do far better than this place | |we became an ambassador member just before spending mother's day at the chicago intercontinental and received a room upgrade to an exceptional room | our saturday night stay was the best $99 we ever spent mother's day special | the welcoming chocolate covered strawberries began the weekend on a high note the concierge continued it by arranging a wonderful dinner moderately priced  and the great sunday breakfast topped it all off | all in all mother's day in chicago was super | we loved it enough to be back for labor day weekend another package | |i stayed at this hotel for a weekend and i thought it was really nice | the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean | the room also had a beautiful view | it had everything you could possibly need | i almost didn't want to leave the room | it was definitly worth the price | i would go back | the clientel was also very helpful | |i'm a frequent business traveler and often in chicago on trips | at times it's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown chicago and this was one of those times | i recently had to pay almost $400 for one night at the allegro | it was absolutely not worth it | the hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers so check-in and check-out were very slow | there were very few elevators which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests | the morning i checked out our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby but the elevator was almost completely full when i got on at the 18th floor so i can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs | the room was extremely small and cramped even though it had obviously been renovated recently | the tv bed and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel | still the rate was way overpriced for such a small room | the best thing about the allegro was the room service which was prompt | the food was good and the prices were very reasonable for room service | from now on if my regular hotels are booked i'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn't worth it | |the james hotel -- i had high hopes with a 5 star hotel | however i was not impressed by it whatsoever | the audi cab service they contend is best was not timely kept me waiting for half an hour at the airport | i felt it was quite expensive just because of the location and rich interiors but the service was not as impressive | their room service was quick but it took long before i could contact them owing to the busy phone extensions | the view from my room was not impressive as well although i shopped a lot around the magnificent mile ending up spending a lot of money | i would have loved a more serene place but had no other choice this time | while check out they kept me waiting for a mere cheque payment | it could be a nice place for a business personnel but this time it was quite a disappointment to me | |i must say this hotel is absolutely beautiful | my wife and i were blown away by the penthouse fitness center and pool all the way up on the 42nd floor | very well designed rooms with great linens and pillows | the bathrooms were a nice change of pace from the boring hotel bathrooms we usually see | overall an excellent experience here great views and close to everything you could want to do in chicago | |the chicago hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic | the hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city | the room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful | i can't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there | |my husband and i stayed overnight at the affinia | prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel not true | since it was a very special occasion and also because we were only staying overnight we didn't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend | however this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences | i've ever had | first the smells the linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy | the odors were not mild and i found it pretty repulsive | i couldn't wait to jump out of bed in the morning to get away from the odors | hard to sleep and certainly didn't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary | i didn't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed | at that point i chose not to contact housekeeping because a i was exhausted and b i didn't want to upset my husband who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing | also the bathroom smelled like vinegar | perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by affinia but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did | incidentally the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days not a well-maintained property | second the elevators if you stay above the first few floors there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar | with so many floors to service and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday these elevators took forever to come and were often full they did | annoying | also on one occasion there were several bottles water and soda left in the elevator clearly the maintenance crew doesn't inspect and clean the common areas frequently | finally and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived | first when we booked we asked for as quiet a room as possible | the hotel is located near northwestern memorial hospital | but its proximity to michigan ave | and the lack of accomodations elsewhere due to the transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end led us to stay here anyway | at check-in the clerk noted our request and said our room was quiet room since it was not next to the elevators | when we arrived at our room we discovered that we were across from the elevators | obviously she was technically correct that we weren't next to the elevators but it was still so close 15-20 feet that we could hear the elevator noise | also since it was a special occasion we asked if we could upgrade | the disingenuous snarky condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade | clearly the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels this is a matter of routine not exception | pretty awful experience all the way around | other reviewers must have very low expectations | can't explain any of the good reviews otherwise | |my family and i went to this hotel on holiday last month | it was a very bad hotel | when we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room | the view from the window was a brick wall | really | we even asked the lasy at the front desk but she said they couldn't put us in a room with a view cause we didn't book one and we couldn't upgrade | also my wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night | another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true our room only had a normal tub | but the tub had no stopper so we could only take showers | the room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices | |the ambassador hotel is located in downtown chicago right off lakeshore drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown | i would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown | the rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay when in fact we had a pretty unpleasant experience | it started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in | i have no problem with this except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him | after checking in we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed | the pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way | the beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows they took over an hour to arrive | i will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future | |i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers recently and i was completely dissatisfied | when i arrived the clerk was very rude to my guest and myself | we finally got all of our things figured out and went to our room | there is a river right outside and i constantly heard boats passing by | my bathroom was disgusting and not to mention very small | i did not have a very pleasant experience at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers | |i never thought i'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home | i am a mother of two children one of which has severe asthma and allergies | i have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years | so when my sister was getting married in chicago i was extremely anxious | the front desk associate rosa was wonderful | she told me that they have allergy friendly rooms | no perfumes no harsh cleaning chemicals no dreaded industry standard feather pillows | i booked a room but was still really worried | i shouldn't have been | ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home | maybe even a little better | they had an air purification system for our room | it smelled so fresh | while my husband took our daughter to the big bar for nachos she never stopped talking about how totally cool it was i ordered room service for my son | the man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating | my son has a lot of food allergies so i was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details | that's always a little humbling but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time | i was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding | the only problem with my stay is that it was too short | we're coming back for our first family vacation since ethan was born | thank you hyatt regency chicago for making this family's visit possible and positive | | |i enjoyed my stay at the ambassador east hotel in chicago | the staff was friendly and helpful from the time i checked in all the way through checkout | the hotel was very clean and well maintained | the beds were very comfortable | the hotel restaurant/lounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day | the only thing i was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel | i reccomend this hotel and i will stay there again on my next trip to chicago | |if you asked me two years ago i would have recommended the talbott hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked | now i have definitely changed my mind | while this hotel is located in a nice area of chicago surrounded by great restaurants shops and affluent people it has really begun to slowly downgrade | as noted by my reviews i am incredibly serious about customer service | if you're in the hospitality industry there is really no excuse for falling short in this category--- but alas the talbott really has | the door staff don't say a word the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things which they always are and the staff have an air of snobbishness | inexcusable since we the customers are paying to stay at their over-priced hotel | perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that i had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because i waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator which when it arrived was packed to the brim | i get that it's an old hotel but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction the other one overflows with people and i am forced to walk eleven flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time which i didn't | i will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting | |i recently stayed at the hyatt regency chicago hotel in downtown chicago | during my three days there i experienced the worst service of my life | we made reservations before-hand and upon arrival our room was already booked | it took us nearly two hours to actually get into our room after being given the wrong key | | when we entered the room the sheets were stained with what seemed to be cherry kool-aid | i am going to assume that it wasn't | after a night on the town we were bummed for money by three homeless men outside the hotel | after arriving in our room and hoping for a nice hot shower we found a note on our door with a sorry note explaining they didn't have any hot water | early the next morning we were awoken by housekeeping we had a dnd sign on our door | so we decided to wake up and go out for breakfast | comes to find out our car was broken into in their parking garage | we filed a police report and the police asked the managers for a video of the surveillance | unfortunately for us their surveillance was out of memory to record anymore | needless to say we left early the next day and i will never return to such a dreadful hotel ever again | |sofitel chicago water tower - my friends and i decided to take a vacation to chicago following our college graduation and we stayed at the hotel sofitel | the rooms were incredible it was the first time i slept on a king-sized bed | all the decor from the little hand soap containers to the wall paper had a touch of luxury | we didn't really spend much time in the hotel bar because it was so close to all the nightlife | likewise we chose not to eat too many meals in the hotel but the breakfast we had was classy and delicious | the view of chicago was beautiful and the deal on the room was incredibly reasonable | it was a cool experience | |having stayed in standard hotels before when my wife suggested we stay in an upscale hotel for our weekend in chicago i was skeptical to say the least | after staying at the amalfi hotel i may never stay in a regular motel again | right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that *gasp* have a clue as to what they are doing | we got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site keefer's steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection | the room was spacious had robes and slippers a stocked mini-bar the mattress was comfy and the whole room was clean | the staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife | in the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which i loved cause i love breakfast but not crowds | unfortunately for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping my wife was in heaven however and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards | the whole trip i believe was made special by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff i would recommend the amalfi to anyone visiting chicago | |i stayed at the swissotel chicago while i was on holiday recently and i have to say that you definitely get what you pay for | i was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised | i was sorely mistaken | the first problem i had was when i got there they told me that they had double booked the suite i had reserved | they gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room | i should have left then but i decided to keep an open mind | after we were all settled in my husband and i went to the palm restaurant | my husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times | each time we asked them to fix it they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff | after dinner we went back to our room | just sitting on the bed i knew it would be a long night | the mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them | when i went to the restroom the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons | my husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one | we just didn't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in | i tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional | he pressed really had and hurt my back | perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session | for lunch we tried geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way | i decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later | once i got sick i was done | i went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because i was not going to sleep there one more night | i made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable | after a lot of arguing he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel | this was the worst place i had ever stayed | i think a super 8 motel would have been more luxurious | |this was my first time staying at the hard rock hotel in chicago and i have nothing but hate for the entire experience | the building itself is maintained however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill | and while the outside appearance is fine and dandy my room 325 was repulsive | as soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room's ground and verbally demanded a tip i noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement before i could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled | immediately i went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour a complete waste of time because as soon as i had reported my problem i was told that no other rooms were available and i would have to make do they did however say i could stay the night free of charge | the next morning as i was set to leave i decided i would try the breakfast in hopes of finding one redeeming quality | let me tell you that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold the worst breakfast i have ever had in my entire life | overall the employees are arrogant and callous with the work ethic of a 2 year old child they cannot cook the room for me was poorly maintained however they are good at refunding your money | |i stayed three nights recently at the hilton homewood suites- downtown chicago | overall i can't rate this establishment highly | the person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation | once i finally got my key the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me | it didn't get any better when i got to my suite | the bed was poorly made and i found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows | the room was very stuffy and i swear might have even had a vague pet smell | my shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower doorand the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip | also the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable | i also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also | it had limited equipment that was in poor repair | the floor in there was even slippery which made it a definite trip hazard | while the indoor pool looked good as i dipped into it the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell | all in all the amenities the unfriendly service and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one i would definitely not recommend to anyone | when that is paired with their sky high room rates it's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests | |often visit chicago but this was my first stay at this location | was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo | thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated | was very disappointed in the service | stayed on a saturday night - waited 20 minutes for extra pillows - called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late | also received an incorrect folio under my dooranother guests that was staying at this location | i called the front dest to inform them of the error - and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected | i opened my credit card statement and found that i was charged for three different rooms - one on the date of my visit and two a week later | i called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department | received a message to call the billing department have called three times - but have not received another reply back | |we booked our room at the swissotel on hotwire for $88 unbelievable rate | and were extremely impressed with the swissotel | the staff was so polite and catered to our every need | the room was oversized clean and had a large bathroom | we had a partial view of lake michigan which was an added bonus | on the 42nd floor they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides | spectacular | we sat in the hot tub and looked down on navy pier | we can't wait to go to the swissotel again | |sofitel chicago water tower - staying at the sofitel chicago was honestly a fairly mediocre experience | for the rate that we got the room was really underwhelming | a lot of the decor was tacky and the feeling was too forced | the hotel bar was overpriced and when we decided to leave the concierge was unhelpful in letting us know about the surrounding nightlife of any sort | the furniture didn't feel uncomfortable but i woke up in the night several times and didn't rest well | i would much rather prefer a generic hotel for the money we spent | |wow | that is all i can say | my girlfriends and i recently went on a little 'excursion' to chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at this beautiful hotel | the rooms were beautifully decorated in a comfortable modern style | the beds were so comfortable and cozy with the softest bedding i have ever felt on a hotel bed | our views were just as amazing | we could even see lake michigan from our suite | we only dined in the hotel once during our trip but it was the best time we had | the aria restaurant was so elegant yet fun | very clean and just a great atmosphere | the staff was extremely professional and courteous going out of their way to ensure our stay was a pleasure from the moment we walked through their doors | highly recommended | a must see next time you visit this area | |i had stayed at amalfi for my weekend visit to chicago | the hotel was easy to find and was close to many establishments for a night in the city | the valet staff was pleasant and courteous | the room was very comfortable and spacious with a large bathroom | the free wifi was a big plus |  being a frequent traveler myself i have frequently faced problems with hotel food | however amalfi provided a breakfast bar on each floor with delicious pastries | for dinner i was able to order food from harry caray's tavern from across the street | i was pleasantly surprised at food options available |  i am totally in love with this hotel and would highly recommend it to my friends | |the sofitel chicago water tower while seemingly a good idea in theory has many drawbacks | at first glance it appears quite luxurious and grand but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked | the hotel is quite tall coming in at 32 stories and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying | the staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed | the hotel tries to adopt a french flavor but its efforts fall short | the only real french influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars | the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment | the same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general | the city's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one's stay here | overall i would not recommend this hotel | make a different choice | |for all the hype and rave reviews of the talbott hotel it seemed to me that it would be a mistake to not stay there not the other way around | the talbott hotel website claims to have opulent accommodations impeccable service and unexpected delights | the last time i checked opulent had a bit of a different meaning than easily outdone by the senile 90-year-old landlord of your college apartment impeccable wasn't code for rude and unfriendly and unexpected delights were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel | overall my stay here simply wasn't worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations | for a lot lessi could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment | |stayed in old tower | room was nice and room service was very good | room wi-fi was expensive as was the bottled water | for the price of the room at least there should at least have been water | i would rate the value as sub-par | the restaurant menu was not great food mediocre by comparison to other downtown chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant | | in summary i will go to the m | | | or h | | | next time | some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of north carolina and earlier this year in northern california | p |s | if you are a fitness room user the $16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel | |i was very disappointed with this hotel | i have stayed in other swissotels and enjoyed them very much but the service can only be described as aloof | there was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information i had given her minutes ago | precise indeed | room service took forever to pick up good sign in a way=busy because they are good but the food arrived very late and very cold | the man tried to replace it but than took another hour and i was never given a price reduction free dessert or anything to apologize | as for cleanliness they must be next to godly as they knocked on my door at 0800 despite the fact i had a doorknocker requesting no service i'm a late sleeper | very disappointed with my stay | this hotel clearly did not help build the chain's reputation | |we stayed at hotel monaco and upgraded to a suite | i was disappointed with the room layout and shabby furniture | i bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground | the make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work the tv reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the $450 we spent there | next time we will go back to trump tower across the street which is far superior to hotel monaco | |we stayed at the intercontinental for three nights last weekend | it is a located in a fantastic spot on the magnificent mile right near the chicago river and the nbc building | we had a double room in the main tower | the room was very clean and updated | the staff were very friendly and helpful | the negatives about this hotel is that you have to pay extra to use the fitness centre and internet access | also parking is high $45 valet/day | overall we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel | we paid $90 on priceline and felt that this was a reasonable price | |did not enjoy my stay at the omni chicago hotel | firstly the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful | there was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle | secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees | considering i paid well over $250 per night for the romance package reservation it was below my standards and i will not be heading back to the omni chicago hotel any time soon | |i booked a room at swissotel chicago because i thought the price was reasonable and at the base price it was however it ended up costing more than i had planned for as you have to pay for parking and other amenities | the service was not very good considering they market themselves as a luxury hotel | there was no one there to help us bring in our bags when we had a difficult time doing so and the staff were cold | all in all i would say it was an average experience | | | not luxurious like they claim it to be | |when we were stranded in chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled our airline put us in touch with hotels |com who found us the room at the sheraton towers | after a long and frustrating day that ended up with us still in chicago arriving at the sheraton was a joy | the entire staff was wonderful | the bell staff was great helping us finally let go of the heavy bags jonathan at check in was very helpful and had us in a room which he upgraded for us in no time | we enjoyed the location and the facilities of this property during our unexpected stay and would highly recommend this location to others | we can't say enough about the staff | if we are in chicago in the future we will definitely return here | |i stayed at this hotel for a week with my family this hotel is huge so clean has comfy beds foods great staff couldnt of being any nicer | stayed here for thanksgiving it was fabulous second time in chicago and still want to go back again  | | | the hotel is within walkin distance to both state street and michicgan avenue |theres taxis right outside the hotel and the concierge can also ring for mini buses if your travelling with a big crowd |theres also a cinema 2 mins away opposite the hotel  | perfect hotel for a great get away  | | | |we stayed at the conrad for only one evening but it was such an amazing room we would have liked to stay longer | we were on the newly renovated 9th floor and the room was gorgeous and super clean | there was a flat screen bose sound system and even an ihome for our ipod | wireless was free and they bring you a free bottle of water at turn down | everyone was very helpful and so friendly | we can't wait to go back again | |palmer house a hilton hotel - i travel with my cat and finding good pet friendly places to stay can be difficult so i'm really glad a friend pointed me to the palmer hilton in chicago |  the rooms were large comfortable and well-kept | bonus points for the extra-wide bathroom mirror double bonus points for having an outlet near but not behind the desk | too many hotels force you to move furniture just to plug your laptop in for work | both the self and and valet parking options were a bit pricey but the hotel location is actually convenient enough that i may forgo my car entirely next time and just walk | a lot of the major must-see places like millenium park or the art institute are just a couple blocks away and multiple bus stops and subway stations are within walking distance as well | the one thing that annoyed me was the fee to access the internet - guessed i've been spoiled by complimentary wifi at other places - but overall i had a very enjoyable experience | would recommend to others | |hotel monaco is a luxurious hotel situated in the heart of chicago | it is blooming with historical elegance combined with modern day amenities | i had the pleasant experience of staying at this facility | perfectly set up to handle any business traveler sight seer convention wedding or shopper | they offer top notch service from reservations to wedding planning or even asking for a good local restaurant | i noticed that world travelers are welcome here with some of the employees ability to speak foreign languages | guest rooms offer stylish charm and can relax even the unrelaxable | in room spa's and top notch room service is second to none | the south water kitchen is a true downtown chicago restaurant offering mid-west american dishes and several signature cocktails | i know that anytime i visit chicago hotel monaco is my place to be | |my stay at the hotel monaco chicago was amazing | the staff are polite and well poised eager to give a helping hand in a short notice | to someone like me who had never even been in the city of chicago it really gave me a good feeling throughout my whole trip | the rooms hallways and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy and whenver i went out i would always find my room perfect  be it for a night of undwinding after one of my conferences or just to hit the mattress and sleep | during my stay i stopped at their restuarant where i had one of the best american style meal in a while | overall the hotel monaco is a place i would surely stay at again if given the chance to visit chicago for a second time | it is truely exceptional | |i booked this hotel for $75 on hotwire with mid-level expectations for one night | totally blown away | arrived on a sunday night | gave car to valet $51/night | lobby was a social people watching scene with swank music | check-in was smooth and easy | i asked for an upgrade and was told no free upgrades to 3rd party bookings | upgrade to suite was available at a cost | i passed since only 1 night stay | i asked for a nice quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine | received room 10-120 | room was huge with 2 beds | felt like 400 square feet | newly renovated last year | bell hop told me some rooms are very small so i totally lucked out | service from start to finish was top notch | everyone had a smile on their face | always spoke with great respect and made us feel welcome | ordered room service at 1045 pm | arrived in 1/2 hour | food was so-so | had pancakes in lockwood for breakfast | very good food and very good service | strong coffee | hotel is right on state street shopping | fyi - rooms on floors 15 and below were renovated last year | rest were done 5 years ago | for the price it was a great bargain | only complaint is bathroom is small | |millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago - despite its somewhat odd name i found staying at this hotel to be a delightful experience | spacious hallways and high-ceilinged lobby give the feel of a mansion as you walk in | the rooms maintain this atmosphere as they are impeccably cleaned and tastefully furnished | the beds are nice and soft and very easy to fall asleep in | free coffee every morning excellent for coffee lovers like myself | one thing to watch out for the texture of the towels feels a bit rough | might want to bring you own | but this is only a minor distraction from an otherwise great stay | i highly recommend the millennium knickerbocker | |the international chicago magnificent mile is shrouded in glamour but underneath the facade fades away | the classical architectural landmark should be translated to old and boring | i found this hotel via google and have regretted it ever since | room size was small and unaccommodating and that was one of the newer rooms | everything was free except for the gym why that wouldn't be free with the price i paid i don't know | this hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get and i would not recommend staying there | |my husband and i snagged a great deal on a weekend trip to chicago and decided at the recommendation of friends to stay at the palmer house hilton | the only word we can use to describe it is amazing | walking into the lobby feels like stepping back in time it is simply breath-taking | be sure to check out the ceiling i have never seen one so beautiful outside of europe | we checked-in without any issues and were assigned a very lovely room with the most comfortable bed i have encountered in any hotel | everything is in walking distance of the palmer house you couldn't hope to find a better location for exploring downtown chicago | everything was perfect with our stay here i would not stay anywhere else in chicago from now on | |we were hungry and tired when we checked into the chicago sheraton | the nice clerk at the front desk got us checked in efficiently and with a warm smile | he made us dinner reservations at shula's giving us time to shower and change and arranged for a bellhop to take our bags up to the room for us - what service | | we enjoyed our steaks and the bottle of wine that was recommended by the waiter at shula's - truly a lovely meal | when we returned to our room we were delighted to find that the towels had been replenished and the bed turned down | we enjoyed the view from our room before turning in and having a very restful night's sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed | kudos to the chicago sheraton for getting everything just right | |staying at the swissotel in downtown chicago is not so much the typical stay so much as it is an experience | not only is the hotel located in a great area to get to all local attractions but while you are at the hotel you will have many amazing accommodations at your disposal | there are two gourmet on site restaurants and a lounge to relax and get great food | the rooms are over sized and the beds are among the most comfortable you will ever find | finally the service is award winning so anything that you do not already have at the swissotel will be at your fingertips with their assistance | overall i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for more than the typical hotel | |stayed here on business a few nights and really liked it | very attractive classy and comfortable hotel that's got an element of sexy and sharp | public spaces are very nice with an open area bar in the front lobby and nice sitting areas | rooms are lovely as well with handsome fixtures and furniture a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed | bathroom amenities and fixtures are sleek and attractive as well | best of all the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the water - both the river and the lake | if you're working in the area it's the best choice for that part of town and i prefer it to the nearby hyatt and monaco | |i stayed here 2 nights for a business conference | the food was pretty good | and they had these really good mints that i couldn't resist | the room was very comfortable and the bed was great | but i was annoyed by many issues | first their internet went down for a couple of hour when i was there on a break from the conference | it wouldn't have been big deal except i needed to do some business while it was down | second the internet wasn't available in the conference rooms | i suppose the conference i attended would have had to pay extra for it | third the chair in the room was too low for the desk so i was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later | fourth on the second night my key didn't work | so i asked for a new one which also didn't work | so i asked for another one and the same thing happened | thankfully the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so i didn't have to go back down to the lobby a third time | then he came back a little later to tell me i was in the wrong room which i wasn't | finally he came back with the right key | fifth the tv had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume | sixth they didn't have the comedy channel | much cheaper hotels do | if this hotel didn't cost so much money all of these things would be minor inconveniences but i would expect more for what i paid | |beautiful hotel in chicago | i visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife | they are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services | i would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago | |chicago hotels the sheraton chicago hotel & towers - while the sheraton chicago is an ok place to stay i simply cannot recommend it over others in the area | while the room itself was ok our bathroom was quite small and even worse it was quite moldy |  the indoor pool was not only small but also too cold | and the worst the hotel's food services were quite limited and expensive | |we stayed at omni chicago for 2 nights in early july july 1-3 | the reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on travelzoo | we got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food&beverages | i also signed up for their loyalty program which was so worth it | i was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid | but i was totally wrong | they treated us extremely well | before our arrival i got an email asking if we needed anything | so i asked for a fridge to store the baby milk | and they arranged it for us without charge  we arrived late on thursday night | our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge i requested | we were given a corner suite on the 10th floor | | |very nice room | | |comfy bed | my husband was really wowwwww | | | the bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed we didn't use the sofa-bed though | we got a high-speed internet as part of the loyalty program | all staff were friendly and helpful | | |front desk valet parking bell boy room service concierge | | | everyone | we used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning | the first day was great | food was great and quick | we also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program | we ordered oj and hot chocolate | they both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning | but we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible | it tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate  also we ordered belgian waffle for our breakfast which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries | | |but we got a plain waffle | so we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those | this is why i didn't give 5 for service | however i reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal | another thing is that it's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor | we could hear siren going on & off during the night | but this is out of the hotel's control though | and i would say that it didn't bother us at all | my baby could sleep very well | overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider omni for our next trip to chicago | |i called on december 6th 2010 at 3 p |m | to book a room for an upcoming weekend getaway and was taken aback when the phone was picked up and promptly hung up without a word | thinking this might have been a simple mistake i gave it another try | a woman introducing herself as toni answered the phone rushed through her introduction sounding incredibly bored and annoyed that she had to answer the phone | barely letting a second go by after her introduction she gave a snotty hello | | before i could open my mouth and tell her never mind | never has a hotel answered my call so rudely | i'd like to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and pin this unpleasant experience to toni however i will not be calling back again in hopes to stay at this hotel during this trip | |i just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel | i had requested a high floor quiet room | neither request was honored | the windows are not well insulated because the traffic car horns and sirens continued all night long | on the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway | the safe in our room did not work | someone had locked it before our arrival | one of the pictures under the tv had been removed leaving a screw sticking out of the wall | the lights are so dim that is next to impossible to read | a small alcove with a stained bench had a reading light that was about 50 watts | our room key cards didn't work so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them | upon returning to our room they didn't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff | the bathroom is small and has no fan so the steam covers the mirrors and unless you leave the bathroom door open it does not clear | on friday night one small cookie was left in our room | what about a second guest | are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie | | | | | | | on sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call | we had not requested to be woken up | | | | the concierge did not know the way to get to o'hare by train and gave us a longer route than was necessary | i have stayed in much better hotels in chicago | | |quieter and more spacious more elegant and worth the money | this is definitely not worth $400 a month | by the way i live in washington dc and am used to city noise | this was unacceptable | |just back from 5 night stay at omni and would thoroughly recommend it | staff bent over backwards to assist in anything no matter how minute | great location on magnificent mile and lots to do there both for adults and my 10yo daughter | if i had to find a fault it would be the extra charges taxes etc for room service bar and restaurant but where is cheap these days | would definitely recommend it especially for families | |i stayed here for 5 nights last summer | i booked the reservation on priceline for $75/night which was the cheapest rate i could find anywhere during a convention week | anyway when i arrived at 11 pm from the airport i was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me | they booked me at a dumpy 2 star motel by the airport | they gave me $20 for a taxi to get there and it cost me $35 | i was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packing/unpacking | the millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foul-up | no free drink no room upgrade nothing | since i booked on the internet i was chopped liver | beware | |i was scheduled to stay at the hard rock in june but had to cancel | i had booked the hotel back in january | when i called six days before my arrival date to cancel i was told that i would be charged for my stay because i did not cancel seven days in advance | i told the customer service rep that i had never heard of such a practice but she said in a very smug manner that i was told back in january | i honestly don't remember being told of the cancellation policy but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel | i for one will never stay at a hard rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice | |we travel to chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown | we were excited to try the swissotel but left disappointed | the actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views the staff was extremely rude | the man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call | he then did not say more than five words which were i need a credit card | the lobby bar had fireplaces and was very cozy | the hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a night cap that was last call | that was fine for us but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a night cap but did not make last call | our night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees | there are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer no need to stay at the swissotel again | definitely don't stay if you're looking for a romantic weekend away the employees will ruin your experience from the second you walk in the door | |just returned from the james hotel after staying at the park hyatt | i have stayed at most chicago hotels pennisula four seasons the ritz fairmont etc | had heard a little about the james and the primehouse at the james | we paid more for the room at the james then at any of the above mentioned hotels | what a disappoitment | the room we stayed in had 2 double beds | the toilet broke and overflowed the tub didnt drain while showering and the huge bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times | the closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all | the room was very small and non descript | much like staying at an ikea but without the color | windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small | the staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly | the room had a huge 52 plasma tv that was nice | there is no way this hotel is 4 star yet | the room rate close to $500 |00 a night was way of of line | we paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels | the rate should have been about half of that | |talbott hotel - so i booked a stay at the talbott hotel which came heavily recommend to me by pretty much everybody i talked to | though a bit on the pricey side i have no regrets choosing this fine establishment | i do recommend for all you looking to save a penny not to valet park | i arrived in the afternoon maybe around two or three and got the keys to my room without much delay | first thing i noticed was how large the rooms are | i stayed in a double queen room and there was plenty of space to move around | the drapes are aesthetic and pleasing to the eye | the pillows are soft and comfortable | each bed is framed with a beautiful brown coating | the bathrooms are roomy with a glass shower and bathtub combination and the two marble sinks are very convenient | there is even a reclining chair and ottoman for me to relax on | the food is a whole different matter | the little market brasserie gives you a wide assortment of food from so many cultures from around the world | the french lemon flavored dishes were delicious and the short ribs were made well | i thought i got them from wherever they originate from definitely not chicago | you also have the choice of eating outside on little tables enjoying the view when it's not to windy that is | overall the spacious and beautiful hotel is a great place for anybody willing to indulge themselves | |what a terrible experience my family and i had at affinia chicago | first of all we reserved a room with 2 queen size beds and received only 1 king size bed with a cot | when we got to the room we found hair balls on the floor as if a cat had previously stayed there | what an absolute terror affinia was and i will never be going back | |last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to chicago | when looking for a hotel we weren't all that interested in price but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown | i did some research and and came across the amalfi hotel chicago | what sparked my interest was it's location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments | located in chicago's river north area it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours both of which were fantastic | after a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments | my wife got the whole works facial manicure and pedicure and hot stone massage therapy while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day | for dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at harry caray's italian steakhouse | best steak i've ever had hands down | when we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful 32 inch hdtv's | for anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of chicago i would recommend the amalfi hotel chicago to anyone | they offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more | |very quaint and romantic yet masculine | i've noticed that at most chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but i guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that | would love to stay again but i must say that i was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm | also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout | |stayed here in november 2011 on a leisure trip to chicago | hotel is very dated with some rooms that just aren't good enough | front desk staff was rude | will not be staying here again - prefer the swissotel and the hyatt properties regency is similarly priced and park hyatt is 3x more and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well kimpton etc | pros -the only hotel that opens onto michigan avenue very close to all of the excitement -eno wine bar has a great selection of cheeses -rooms are clean cons -some hotel rooms just make no sense - our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge effectively no view and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall actually no view -you have to pay for everything - internet gym and the pool which was not available due to renovation | | | -entire hotel was very old not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one -front desk staff was rude| |if you are ever going to visit chicago and need a place to stay i recommend this hotel | this hotel made my stay in chicago one that i will always remember | the rooms were very big and luxurious everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service | the room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so i could get anything whenever i wanted | the price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because i got great service and i saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite | if you are ever going to be in the chicago area and need a hotel to stay in i recommend this hotel | |my experiences with the hotel were not pleasant | the moment we got to our room the room was not done | we were missing soaps shampoo and towels which just goes to show how disorganized the staff was | the hotel had told us that they would bring a trundle bed for the children but it took us four calls to the front desk to finally get them to bring it | the restaurant was overpriced for the food and selections were limited at breakfast | the place was not kid friendly at all âŠ“ we needed to get a cab to get to the kid friendly attractions and there were many conferences going on in the hotel | i would not recommend this hotel for families | |after staying at the omni chicago hotel i can honestly say that i will take the time to book a room ahead of time on my next visit to chicago | we were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place | the outside of the hotel was pristine but our room was filthy | we requested a non-smoking room but it had obviously been smoked in before as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air | in fact we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well | to top it off room service brought us the wrong item | when we checked out we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item even after we sent it back | i would also have to point out that michigan avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class | right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes | i couldn't even go to the gas station after 8 p |m | because i was too scared to leave the hotel | the pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to | for the price of the room i would say this place was a definite disappointment | i have learned my lesson to check out the room before i agree to stay in it next time | this place gets 1/2 of a star from me | |the hotel is located in an hard to fins location in chicago the dining room for dinner is uncomfortably crowded the room service is hard to reach overall it was not a pleasant hotel stay | |i stayed at this hotel for 1 night | we just wanted to stay in downtown chicago | this hotel is right next to john hancock building | walking distance to many shopping restaurant and everything else | from valet people to front desk people they were all very friendly and helpful | the best thing about this hotel other than the awesome location is that all rooms are suites | you can choose 1 king or 2 double which will be inside the room and you get another sofa bed in the living room area | you get 2 tvs also | the roof top pool over looking michigan lake was lovely also | |sofitel - for our fifth anniversary my husband and i stayed at the sofitel in chicago and we absolutely loved it | after the long flight from california the thing we needed the most was some quality rest and relaxation | and of course the sofitel did deliver | upon arrival we were greeted by the one of the most friendly staff we have ever met which made check-in rather seamless and easy | we were treated like royalty even when we were escorted to our excellent modern-style rooms | we had such a wonderful time at the sofitel that we unfortunately didn't have enough time to see the nearby magnificent mile or the hancock tower | at the end of our stay we decided that we will do a proper tour of chicago the next time we visit the sofitel | |although the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago claims to be an affordable upscale hotel in the heart of chicago it is somewhat expensive starting at $200 per night | there are very few special discount rates available for the budget conscious traveler | the rooms are modern looking and a little less cozy than one might prefer | the carpeting in the rooms is a little outdated and somewhat dirty in a few areas | the views from the rooms are not as great as they could be | the hotel seems to be understaffed and the heating unit in the room is hard to adjust to the right temperature | although the hotel is located on chicago's famous michigan avenue it is a $40 taxi ride from o'hare airport and a $36 taxi ride from midway airport both rather pricey options | if you chose to drive there the valet parking charge is a hefty $53 | again not very budget friendly | all in all even though the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago is close to some of the major chicago attractions it is only an average hotel on many levels | |the elevator system was impossible | it seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse | many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells | it happened several times | i had read about it before booking but guess i didn't take it seriously | it'd be a deal breaker for any future return unless i heard clearly it was improved | also i always think it's lame that you have to pay extra for wifi | area recommendations north michigan avenue and lake front areas are best | |fairmont chicago - i recently stayed two nights at the fairmont while i was in chicago for a job interview | the hotel was actually just a block from my interview location which was super convenient | the room was pretty nice clean and with windows that actually opened | i found an iron and fullsize ironing board in the closet which was great because i always forget to ask for those | i think there was an extra fee if you wanted wifi access in your room but the lounge downstairs had free wifi and plenty of cozy seating | overall a pleasant and convenient experience i'd definitely stay there again | |this is best hotel bargin in chicago if you are not overly unhappy with a small room | great hotel just redone by kimpton | this is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of escape and fun to all of their hotels | this is a location just off of lasalle and next to the cadillac theater | it has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing italian meal | the wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants | the kimptons have a social hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels | you sit in a designer kind of london circa 1968 couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests | they are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it | the exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well | there are two other kimptons here but for the money the allegro is the best value and location | always consider kimptons as they never disappoint where ever we have used them | |our stay at the james in late last august exceeded our expectations | my husband was in chicago for a business trip and i tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life | when we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly | he met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions | the lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive | our room was also very clean | i could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet | the bed was comfortable and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in | it has been awhile since i have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin | my husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month | the bathroom was also impressive | the water pressure was not something i had to mess with to get perfect and the heater took no time at all to warm up | even though i had brought my own shampoo and conditioner i did give the amenities in the bathroom a try and like everything else they exceeded my expectations | i did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms however my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities | i truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel and if we are ever in the chicago area again we will definitely be staying here | this hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure | |elegant and modernized hotel with great staff | location is wonderful | the health club located in the hotel had everything needed to get my complete workout | i will be staying there again due to the wonderful experience and decent prices | |in from minneapolis and was hoping to stay on michigan ave at hotel | when we arrived we were told a previous guest had extended their stay so we did not have a room | the hotel moved us to another hotel 2 miles away in a less than desireable location | management on duty was unfriendly and even stated they would call security if we did not leave | they gave us $15 for cab fare | will never stay there again | happened to numerous guests the same weekend | |when we arrived the check in process was fairly quick however the staff seemed in a bad mood all around | they seemed as if we were taking up their time | when we got to the room we tried to use our personal computer to look for attractions and after having to pay $10 a day for wifi it was a total waste of money the speed of the internet was extremely slow | the free workout area was also not up to our expectations but since it was free we didnt complain | overall we would never stay at this hotel again and we do not recommend it | |the entrance and room was spacious and modern yet elegant | it was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of chicago | the drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds | indeed it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots | |this is a tough one to review | | | as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average | | | | 2 is where it was | here are my tips and props/complaints room 1 star | i had a corner suite | the room was pretty nasty actually 2703 | |stay away from it | | | | there was a constant banging noise from above | when i first got in i thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding | after an hour i knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong | well the sound continued on for 3 days | not that i minded too much as i keep things on for white noise | | | but it sure would bug others | also there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa | in addition it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa | also there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat | i could not imagine all the dna left on that thing either | *gags* bathroom nice size but not great | the faucet was lose really lose and the toilet would not flush right | service great | everyone i encountered did a great job making me feel welcome | good stuff | food i had meetings there so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made | it was really good | | | much better than most hotels | bar very cool | good music great service and good drinks | the scene was decent as well | small bar but was not cramped | so maybe other rooms are nicer | | | well hell they better be | regardless if one room is like that especially a suite i have to think others are like that as well | it is too bad though | the views are great and they actually have windows that open | | | big shocker for the city in general | |the hotel sofitel chicago water tower bills itself as a 4-star luxury hotel but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder | filled with trite modern art and modular cheap-looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest ikea catalogue this 32-floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels i have ever seen | urban chic design does not equal comfort the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use | room service is expensive slow and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor | the hotel features two bars the cafe des architectes bar and the simply named le bar | cutesy french names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make | excellent service fair prices friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great none of which you will find at either of these bars | cafe des architectes is also a restaurant offering seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with french roots which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality | even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak | pass this one by if you're looking for a comfortable enjoyable stay in downtown chicago | the water tower is dry | |location location location | what a great find | excellent well-run small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it | rooms are good-sized and clean good bed and shower with tub | the air conditioner as mentioned in other reviews is noisy but it's a minor complaint | the staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge | the on site restaurant is great | the red-line el is about 3-4 blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze | you are footsteps away from rush street and north michigan avenue and lake michigan | i would not have a moment's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future in fact i wouldn't book anywhere else | |i choose the homewood suites in downtown chicago because i called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of chicago | well when we arrived it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service which it had been since tuesday this was saturday | once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in i figured our relaxing time had begun | well we got our room key and headed for the17th floor | again waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room | i put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room - yup we got double booked | the family was very nice and seemed ok with their surprise visitors | said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out | we have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed | made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation | i did get an apology and a new room | new key in hand waited again for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room | finally got to our room only to find it was a king suite | we are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys | there was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa | so really annoyed now i called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though i had specifically asked for two beds when i booked | it said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when i checked in | she went so far to but two beds on my reservation paper work | the operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor | the only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area | now i paid a total of 349 |00 for one night for this room | we got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal | i am pretty sure my next trip to chicago will not include this hotel | i can tell you that we are frequent hws/hilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future | |amalfi hotel chicago – it was a wonderful trip to chicago with friends and stay at amalfi hotel made it still more amazing |  we had watched the virtual tour before selecting this place for our stay and were happy to find the things exactly same as it was in the video | it was little noisy to stay closeby street but my overall experience was good | i was impressed with the room and bathroom as it was quite spacious and clean | we had a good interaction with staff members and they were very friendly and helpful | we had many varieties for food and the rates were reasonably good | i liked this hotel very much | i would suggest staying at amalfi again in any case | |my wife and i just spent a long weekend at the hardrock chicago hotel and although i am not one to normally write long email i felt it necessary to bring some of the disappointing experiences from our recent syat 2/14 to 2/17 to your attention |issues included our friends ordered chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arriving on 2/14 and we never got them | our friends later on 2/16 asked us if we had received the strawberries and we responded no | they then brought this to the attention of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary bottle of champagne | we were then disappointed again upon checking out however when we were accidentally billed for the complimentary champagne - which was later subtracted from our bill | the in-room dvd player didn't work | it was approximately 11 pm on 2/15 when we called the front desk for help with trouble-shooting the issue | the person responded friendly that al the engineer will be calling you back shortly to help | 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was al | a great and friendly guy but we were waiting for a call back not the arrival of a service tech - keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed | when al was not able to fix the dvd player he graciously told us order a movie on us - thru the in-house movie selection | the problem that didn't work either | again al was awesome and called the service provider but they weren't able to fix it until after midnight | finally after midnight al called us back but by then the movie watching mood had sort of passed | i ended up watching the film hitman alone as my wife had already gone to sleep |the thermostat in our room didn't work regardless of the temperature we set it to set to 65 degrees - actual temperature = 76 degrees | we had so many other unresolved issues that we didn't feel it necessary to voice any more |  | | |read more| |do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room that was supposed to be ready with used towels and the mouthwash opened and used | what about when they left the towel for the floor the foot towel to dry my face | what about the slippers that although being still in the bag had all the sole broken and left tiny plastic parts over the way to the garbage all over the room de facto | i didn't realise that would happen to me until i saw paris hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an idiots to go to a company that has been able to create her | shame on us actually | |i received the type of room that i had reserved | cleanliness seems to be an issue with the maid staff | the carpet had debris and the bathroom needed attention | room service was adequate but not great | the walls seem to be paper then as i heard one neighbor's tv for most of the night and the other neighbor's late enjoyment | |hilton chicago - hilton chicago is definitely a good option if you want to spend some quiet time in the city | it is not that close to the downtown but you can go to the lakefront and the aquariums nearby | the architecture of the lobby and rooms gives a feel of history | this is one those places with updated service but old-style charm | you suddenly feel like you are in a different era |  i liked the health club and saunas | the rooms were comfortable but i could see a little tear on the walls | but overall ideal place to stay for a vacation | | |my boyfriend and i were amazed by the breathtaking view of lake michigan | we are from texas so the view of the city was very important to us | we had no problems at this hotel | | | rooms service location were top notch | |stayed 5 nights at this great hotel | updated rooms | clean | used tim to book theater and dinning reservations | provided excellent service | close to subway shopping and dinning | excellent value | free wireless internet and access to nearby health club very nice perks | highly recommend it | future concern is adjacent construction of condos | not a problem while we were there but something to ask front desk about in the future | |beautiful views and awesome service | my husband and i stayed at the swissotel in chicago while meeting up with some old friends from college | we have been to chicago a few times but never stayed at this hotel before | first off the architecture and feel of the hotel is just amazing | so beautiful | the views from our corner suite was breathtaking and the accomodations were flawless | the fact that we could have an apartment like setting rather than a cold hotel room made all the difference | from the big tub in the bath to the entertainment system and work area everything is in place to make your stay like being at home but with an awesome view of the chicago skyline | we took advantage of the executive club for desserts and breakfast and had dinner one night at the palm restaurant | delicious food | we will definitely stay at the swissotel the next time we visit chicago | |my experience at the ambassador east hotel was truly terrible | i went to chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding | this hotel was recommended by the wedding party | it was a terrible choice | despite the special discount we got because of the wedding the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels | the staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children | my kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason | the place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items | my son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart | overall i would say i was very displeased with the staff the hotel's attitude towards children and the expense of the hotel | on the plus side our window had an excellent view of the city | still i would not return here again | |the affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to chicago | my wife and i stayed in an upgraded suite | very large room that is modern and has all the little touches | the staff was extremely helpful and professional | the location is excellent | the price is a good value for what you get | we simply couldn't find anything to criticize | highly recommended | |our stay at the sofitel was definitely below our expectations | the staff was less than nice to me after i waited several minutes until i was noticed | at first my reservation could not be found so i was provided a spare room | the hotel was fairly neat | however once we got to the room and onto the bed we found the bed to be noisy | just sitting on it made a squeaking noise that was unpleasant | we immediately called down to the front desk and informed them of our concern | we were told to go back downstairs to settle things out | once we got downstairs we were provided with another room number | however we had to wait half an hour for another room to be cleaned and prepared | for such a well reviewed hotel i was highly disappointed with the amount of time i had to spend to get settled into a room | |stayed valentines weekend | got the 5th floor with a direct view of the building next door | you have to pay extra for the pool and the ice machine was out on our floor | parking nearby sucks as most of chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car | glasses were dusty and gross | this location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge so when you barely touch it you'll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door | had i been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time | |hilton chicago - everything about my stay was fantastic | the beds were comfortable | the view of the harbor from the 5th floor was fantastic | the service was reliable | and it was a short walk from mercat where they served bacon wrapped dates | they're better than they sound | however don't rent a car because the traffic is horrible after 5 | |went to chicago for a week in may decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton we were not disapointed | perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level | we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each | they beds and pillows were too die for so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles | all the staff were very helpful | a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful | about 2 blocks away on harrison is a cafe called orange which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast the cafe and the staff are suberb | expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning | |we booked an american girl place package at fairmont chicago millennium park | told that we'd have a room with a nice view apparently their idea of a nice view is of another building | ended up getting a smoking room when we booked non-smoking cost us $100 more a night than we were told and staff was incredibly rude at the restaurant | would never recommend coming here for any reason whatsoever | |i had wanted to stay in this hotel since i had heard about how historic it is and i was highly disappointed with my stay there | the room that i was given was dirty and when i went back to the front desk to inquire about it they disregarded my concerns | it took them a very long time to get me a new room and they whole time they were very unprofessional and did not make me feel welcome | i did not stay in the hotel all night since the people in the rooms around mine were unruly and were making noises all night long | i left that night but not before demanding a refund | |i went here with the family including our dog marleythey are very pet friendly | we really enjoyed it | this place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment | it also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event | i will definately be coming back next time i need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel | |we stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business part family fun trip in july | we were very impressed with the location within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping inlcuding water tower place a great mall | | we were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size | the bedspreads were filthy and so thin | the room decor is in dire need of an upgreade | the bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew | the shower actually had mold in the corners | this was a very tight squeese for 4 people | especially the bathroom | the beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable | even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people | thank goodness there were a few elevators | luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price | the only upside was the great location | also beware- its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle | millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab | |i just left the conrad chicago and have nothing but good things to say | we used hilton points to stay there but paid $35/night to upgrade to a junior suite | we were in room 1519 | i would reccomend people ask for an odd numbered room so that they will have a view looking north on michigan ave | our room was very modern with 2 large hd/flat panel tv and bose 3 speaker sound system | 4 big windows that actually open | the bed lineds were very nice the towels were ok | the room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub | marble everywhere | robes slippers etc | the work out room was good with different machines and some free weights | there are clean towels in the workout room too | we never ate in the hotel so i can't comment on the food or the prices | there is a starbucks across the street michigan and an espresso bar attached to the nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel | it was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel | the location of the hotel could not be better | we were walking distance to everything | every kind of shopping or dinning experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles | over all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain | |i recently stayed at the palmer house hilton on a business trip to chicago | i will do my best to make sure that future employees of my company do i have to stay here | when the reservation was made an early check-in was arranged -- due to travel arrangements my travel companion and i were to get to the city in the early hours of the morning | we had arranged an early check-in without having to pay for the night before | there was no fuss raised when we agreed on this and so we assumed it would be fine | when we got there however there were no rooms available for us for hours and they refused to keep our bags | we were forced to change clothes and wash up in the public restrooms of the office building where our first meeting took place and cart our bags around with us | they offered insincere apologies and didn't offer to comp us anything for the inconvenience | the rest of the stay one night was nothing to praise | i guess not having bugs would count as positive | i would definitely never recommend that anyone stay here | |fairmont chicago was a great choice for my wife and i | we couldn't resist the elegant aria restaurant and the accommodations | the room was impeccably clean and the city view was utterly amazing | from the moment we checked in the staff produced a positive atmosphere with genuine hospitality | my wife even suggested we should have had our wedding reception in their beautiful ball room | overall i would rate fairmont chicago a 10/10 | |after reading good reviews about the affinia hotel in chicago my husband and i decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary | unfortunately the hotel missed the mark for us | i did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel | because my husband and i have had a bad experience with bedbugs as a rule we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel | when i brought this to the attention of the front desk staff they practically accused us of planting the bugs there | i was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled | needless to say we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary | i have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation | i have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that i will be refuting the charge for the one night the affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline | |we booked our hotel stay thru yahoo and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds | when we got to the hotel not only did they not have a room for us we pre-paid | but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online they could only give us what was available | the hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after i got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us | if you book online - beware | you may not get what you paid for | they did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room | |i really enjoyed staying at this hotel | the separated living room and bedroom made it feel like i was renting a nice furnished apartment instead of a hotel room | the kitchen was a comfort since i could prepare a meal for myself if i wished and the refrigerator and microwave was a must since i never finish my meals when i go out to eat | i felt more at ease here rather than the detatched feeling i have with most hotels | i would recommend staying at this hotel if you want to feel comfortable and welcome in a sophisticated atmosphere | |while traveling in chicago i stayed at the sofitel on chestnut street | though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest service was severely lacking | i arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn | i reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area | i complained that i had not been informed of the construction and requested another room | my complaint was totally disregarded | i was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available | when i explained that the noise was bothersome i was treated rudely | the woman at the front desk actually ask me if i thought she could make the workers stop | i understand that the staff has no control over the noise | they did however know about the construction | information i did not have at the time i booked | information that would have swayed my decision | then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention | i will not be staying there again | |the james hotel met and exceeded our expectations | a haven of cool uncluttered comfort in a hot crowded but congenial city | located within steps of some of the greatest art architecture culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in north america the staff of the james provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited | the check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm restorative oasis | it is difficult to over-praise the friendly attentive staff this is a hotel that truly has its act together | the day before our visit ended we experienced problems with the room's air conditioner | when the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the chicago skyline | we eagerly await the opening of new james hotels in other cities | |i stayed at the allegro hotel while interviewing for a position in chicago | i read the reviews and they were mixed but since the property was suggested by the organization due to location i booked a room | true to the reviews the room was extremely small was cold the heater blew in cold air in -2 degree weather and just generally uncomfortable | there was no closet so i hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room | the bathroom was extremely small and although tidy not especially clean it was dusty | the bed which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full was quite low and the sheets were hard | because i arrived late i ordered room service | there was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desk/table sideways | although there is free wireless a plus i kept getting kicked out of the system and had to no lie reconnect on-line a record 16 times | finally to top it all off the television stopped working just a little before midnight | i was only there for one evening not even 12 hours but that was enough for me | this is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but i've stayed at better 2 star properties | on the positive side the staff is nice and friendly the food is reasonably good and the lobby is really vibrant | there is a martini bar although as i was coming in a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey that looked interesting | overall though not the best stay i've had | i won't be staying again | |for a hotel that touts its luxury location in chicago the talbot is very poor think motel 6 at a hilton price | carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin | they are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of | for the prices they charge $350 |average price for two people | it seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby which was happening while i stayed could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms | but i guess the talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests which i won't be | |the room was very pretty and the location is great but the hotel is so big and they don't have the staff to take care of everything | the heating in our room was loud making it difficult to sleep | the gym is not big enough and the hotel parking garage is very expensive | the hotel has so many guests that the lobby was too loud to relax in | we didn't get great service at the hotel bar and the bar ran out of bar snacks because so many people were in the bar area | later we asked for directions to the restaurant we had dinner reservations at and the hotel staff we asked did not know how we could get there | the next morning the cleaning staff tried to get in while we were still in the room | |from the moment i stepped into the ambassador east hotel i was very much impressed | | the entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant | the bell staff escorted my husband and i right up to our suite | our suite was beyond belief | the atmosphere was very classy and romantic | my husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived | we had traveled to chicago from new york for a romantic weekend get away | we had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant the pump house and were very pleased | dinner started with soup and a salad main course meal and dessert all for a reasonable price | we did a little local shopping the next day after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds | every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience | we enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the ambassador east hotel the next time that we are in chicago illinois | 5 stars | | | | |i wouldn't know how to begin to write something negative about the millenium knickerbocker hotel in chicago | everything about this hotel is fantastic from the outside of the building to the hotel lobby all the way to the rooms | with very clean and plush rooms this is the place to stay | when you are not at the hotel eating at the elegant dining area or having a great breakfast first thing in the morning there is plenty to do around the town | take a shopping spree down michigan ave or head to one of the museums or the pier to look around | whatever you decide to do you can't go wrong | this place is wonderful | |this is the hotel for the discriminating business traveler | it offers spacious rooms that are elegant and refined | with a cozy area complete with chairs and fireplace they are the perfect place to entertain clients or discuss strategy for a business meeting with a colleague | the restaurant offers just the location to impress a perspective client | and all of this elegance and refinement in the heart of downtown chicago| |elegant lobby comfy beds nice sheets but we were given a not fancy a little dated room on the 5th floor which had a view of the monstrous venting structure and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night | at the hilton one is charged for internet access on each device per hour | we stayed in the middle of ohio and received total access for free | we didn't drink the $6 |00 water or try the $28 | breakfast buffet | the staff was friendly but of course you tip for a smile | they did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a fold-out couch as we were a party of 5 | didn't use the gym or pool on the 8th floor but looked nice small pool | no view of the water possible though we were right at grant park | we tried to view the fireworks from a higher story no such luck |  | | |read more| |the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is not the hotel for persons wishing to have a relaxing getaway | upon entering this hotel you have the impressions that it is a warm and inviting place | one encounter with the staff will change this point of view immediately | the person who assisted us was not very knowledgeable with his duties and did not provide the overall attention required or expected | everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication | training for the staff should be conducted immediately in order to match classy look of the hotel with their interactions with the customers | i am truly diappointed with the fact that my stay at this hotel was as substandarded as it was | i was so looking forward to a wonderful stay at your establishment | i hope that the issues mentioned earlier are resolved | however i do not plan to return to this hotel again | |my husband and i made a reservation at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers for a much needed weekend getaway | we took off work early friday to beat traffic | once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking | we drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel | upon checking in we were informed that the floor where our room was located was in the process of having the carpets cleaned | we decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation | we took the elevator which smelled like urine up to our room | we did see some carpet cleaning machines unattended in the hallway | i hoped for the sake of safety no children were staying on this floor | we walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine | the overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us | we called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms | he rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings | just then the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and i could not hear anything else my husband said | we decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel | it was an awful experience | |the hotel monaco claims to be a boutique chicago luxury hotel but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish | the pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view but that was certainly not the case for this customer | the decor which might be cutesy or charming to some was actually quite tacky and outdated | the bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be one of the top 40 hotels u |s | don't be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photos--this hotel does not live up to its billing | you will be disappointed as was i if you expect anything more than a run-of-the-mill experience at a merely average hotel | |i made my reservation at the hilton chicago believing i was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities | unfortunately my stay at the hilton chicago went downhill from the moment i checked in | there was only one clerk at the front desk and several guests already waiting ahead of me | once i finally got checked in and located my room i discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk | finally i made it into my room | it appeared nice enough until i went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged | the manager moved me into a new room so i can't complain too much but still it was a hassle | finally settled i was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning | that is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call i had not requested | needless to say my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and i will choose other accommodations for my next trip to chicago | |my wife and i travelled to chicago and really were treated like royalty by the hotel staff | my brother and his wife also stayed during this period | the front desk staff the concierge the star bucks server the restaurant the lounge servers  |  |  | all were wonderful | the rooms were spacious and the flat screen tv was really great | the bath room was a real plus  | | | it was huge and had everything one desires | great view from 20th floor to michigan avenue below | overall great stay and highly recommended | |the only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other kimpton hotels | it was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee | the robes were not in the room and it took a long time hours but other than that a great place | the concierge was excellent | |as we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said we picked the right place | having chosen the talbott from other trip advisor reviews i found myself thinking in terms of a trip advisor review when we arrived | nice entrance friendly reception i noticed everything and immediately knew the talbott was a non-corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains | the smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of europe simple not overstated but elegant | the location is great there was light snow but we walked to the art institute rush street the theater district and we're from california where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside | all i can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort class and somewhere unique stay at the talbott | oh yeah we were in a room that looked down at the construction we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound it was very quiet | |monaco - my wife and i stayed at the monaco for a few days and ended up not being impressed |  we were first greeted rather rudely by the attendant up front and then had to wait quite a while for our reservation to be pulled up |  they even served other guests before us even though we had been waiting |  the rooms were clean and tidy but seemed to lack personality |  in fact they felt rather sterile |  bathrooms were cramped and lacked soap and shampoo while the rooms were bare in terms of furniture |  i didn't feel like a guest but rather someone who was just being shuffled in and out |  the food they had wasn't too good and i would have preferred food from any of the surrounding restaurants |  overall i would say to pass on this one | |we went with the great reviews on tripadvisor | the location rooms amenities and price via expedia were good | my complaint is the poor service at every stage - the check-in was slow even at 1am the concierge sarita was hopeless staff were generally rude | also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night - we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning | finally just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse | | | would i stay here again | - maybe if i got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby | |the thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable | the room was very clean the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot | other than that it was a great place to stay | |hard rock chicago i had gone to chicago for my spring break last march to meet friends from other universities | i was looking for an inexpensive hotel downtown to stay with my friends | as it was spring break all of them had been booked | we booked the hard rock chicago as it is for a younger crowd | got a room for $359 which is quite expensive  for a college student | well at first it seemed really nice but there were so many hidden charges like $40 a day for parking | if a hotel charges me $359 for a room i expect parking to be included | the mini bar was also very expensive | the housekeeping staff was not very prompt we had our room cleaned at 4 p |m | | | the room service was also quite slow | | |also as we were on a lower floor there was a lot of noise from the road | the restaurant was good with a good band | however for the price i paid i had expected a lot more | it was overall a disappointment | |millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago âŠ“ this summer i have stayed two days at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago | iâŠ™ve had a fantastic experience and can say that it is worth every single penny | i have stayed at a superior room and it was one of the largest hotel bedrooms iâŠ™ve ever seen | the bed was comfy and it had an amazing view | the decorators have also done a good job because the room is beautifully full of precious details | i donâŠ™t remember all the amenities of the room because i havenâŠ™t used all of them but having a 40âŠ hd tv and a coffee maker was nice | the only con was the wireless internet that was paid and it was really expensive luckily i have 3g | i definitely recommend this hotel | |i believe i can not describe how amazing was our stay at the james | service was impecable from the door man to the front desk | location could not be better | yes you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor but come on you are downtown what do you expect | | | |overall noise was not in a level to bother us | the only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm | | |pm not am | go figure | | | |i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel for two nights and i must say the service they rendered was quite impressive | they had very attentive and friendly staff members | the room that i stayed in was spacious for me and my husband | their hotel restaurant served the most delicious steaks i have tasted i ordered a classic fillet mignon and it was cooked to perfection | i would definitely stay at this hotel again if ever i come back to chicago and would absolutely highly recommend this to my friends and family | |while staying at the swissotel chicago i experienced some of the worst customer service i have at any hotel | the front desk was extremely rude while checking out and even seemed to try to hurry us out | the fitness center was always packed and i was never able to get on any of the machines as was the pool area | while eating at the restaurant i felt it was a very overpriced meal but it was very elegant looking | the last issue i had with the hotel was the valet parking it took them awhile to get my car and they actually pulled the wrong car around | it was another 10 minutes while i waited for them to sort the issue out | the worst part by far was the customer service and although the hotel looked nice it wasn't worth the stay with the way i felt i was treated based on the money i was spending | next time we are in chicago we will be staying somewhere else | |this hotel has a great location and very friendly staff | however the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition | i use to be a regular at this hotel  |  |  | but have not been back for 15 years | rooms have not been well maintained old carpets frayed at doors wall paper peeling off of the walls tv's from the 80's | there is currently construction going on in the lobby area making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door | |avoid the talbot especially for group functions | my in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests | they were lured in by promises from the talbot that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide special personal treatment | nothing could have been further from the truth | they failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception they persistently confused reservation requests they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests his wife and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight | now the worse part | mistakes are made even hotel managers are human but where a hotel which is supposed to be in the hospitality service can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error | case in point i had requested on several occasions when i made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card all expenses they assurred me that this would be no problem | of course when my brother his wife and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card | | | again despite them having my card on record and despite my explaining this to them over the phone | my brother recalls the indignation of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card | then another guest in this case my older brother came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby | when i finally was able to get across town leaving a cubs game early i again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account | again they agreed but never did anything about it | in the end when my older brother checked out on sunday he was told everything was alright but when he went to his atm his account was frozen from unathorized overuse | the hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained | when he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events | i spent sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on monday the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone calling the talbot the credit card fraud division my brother etc trying to solve this situation | the most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager who at one point suggested that i was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters | | | | this was a witnessed event and her insinuation was that i was lying and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake | in the end there is no one running this place | | | managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail | when i was finally able to get the name of the general manager after two daysm neither he nor his assistant would ever call back | the communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant | fortuneatly the staff at the signature room where we had the reception was beyond excellent so the day was not lost but the the talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests | try the ambassador east same neighborhood cheaper much more professional staff | |i found this wonderful hotel  | the location is awesome just minutes away from all the shopping restaurants and bars you could possibly want  | i was in town for an interview so i was really nervous  | i ended up suggesting the hotel restaurant for my interview and they took such a good care of us they made me feel so comfortable that i was hardly nervous at all | and the place was pack | the room was superb | really cool design  | i had a room they call an apartment and it was fantastic | the natural light you get in this room is awesome and i am very sensitive to dark places | they have a full bar in the room  which i was able to use to entertain my friends that night | i went to the gym for a little bit of exercise and i have to say i have never seen such a extensive facility in a hotel | all the staff made me feel like i was family | they were available to me at any time and so friendly  | i will definitely be back for another stay | |my wife and i booked a room at the hilton chicago three weekends ago as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel | we were expecting some minutia of luxury | however this was not the case with the hilton chicago | first we had reserved a room with a king size bed but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed | now we did get a reduced price because of this but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked | second we had to change our room key twice | the room keys they used supposedly lost their charge | this is what the front desk told us | so we had to go up to our room find out the key didn't work then come back down stairs get a new key then get back in | this was highly unprofessional and they really need to look into their key system | lastly we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room | we knew this was accurate but i always check just in case | but two weeks later when i checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card | i had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card | suffice it to say we will not be staying there again | |we were encouraged to stay at the affinia as part of a group in town for a chicago wedding | we booked our rooms 6 months in advance with the promise of a brand-new full service hotel in a great locaiton in chicago | the lobby was non-existant under construction | the front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful | the hallways and elevators are small cramped and uncomfortable | the rooms are great - great beds great television set | no room service - the kitchen is under construction | the bottom line is that during our stay this was not a full-service hotel and should not have charged what they did | we were totally disappointed hope it will improve but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of chicago's truly amazing hotels | it is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal | |the omni was chosen for it's location whichworked out perfectly | the bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean  | | |until | | |i sat down in the tub | | |there was black mold in the soap holder in the cracks on the walls between the tile all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl | needless to say i drained the tub and took a shower | | |i really don't care for showers | oh yes | | |the toilet leaked as well | | |the staff were very helpful but i was disappointed | i travel extensively and don't think i will return | we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel printed the presentation and delivered it to our room | they try | we booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building | | |but we weren't there too much | |if you want a 5-star hotel with 1-star service make sure you book your next chicago stay at fairmont chicago millennium park | when i checked in to the hotel i had to wait at the desk for over ten minutes with no line | i was greeted with no thank you for your patience or anything similar | the room was fine but nothing too glamorous or outstanding | the internet cost $14 |95/day which is outrageous considering the price of the hotel itself | the thing that pushed me over the edge however was the valet parking | when i wanted my car in the morning i had to wait 15 minutes to be acknowledged the valets were talking to each other and ignoring me altogether | and for this service i was charged $51 |00/night | | | | when i went to complain at the front desk they just said that sometimes the valets get overwhelmed and you have to exercise patience | i will exercise patience as i check out of this hotel | | | |the swissotel chicago is a delight to visit | located in downtown chicago this hotel has nine different styles of room accommodations to serve everyones taste | they have children friendly rooms as well as the exquisite presidential suite | rooms have exceptional views of downtown chicago | this hotel also has a penthouse fitness center and pool for entertainment | other places to stop by to eat is the palms geneva and the lobby lounge | |homewood suites chicago - a new employee at groupon i was placed in homewood suites for a while until i could find housing in chicago | the room was okay but nothing amazing | the decor was really plain for a hotel room i felt like i was staying at my grandparent's house and not a modern 4-star hotel | the kitchen only featured a microwave and stove top and the bathroom felt more akin to a walk-in closet | although the room sucked i didn't have to stay that much time in it it's only half a block from magnificient mile | |this hotel is amazing i would recommend everyone to stay at least one night here if they had the chance | i stayed here on my first honeymoon and they had all the accommodations i expected plus more | i was floored by the friendliness of the staff and they definitely went the extra mile to make everything perfect without any hassle | the restaurants at the fairmont were amazing as well | when staying at this hotel food and wine at their best are portrayed | if i had to make the choice to stay here again the only thing that i would do differently is schedule the stay to be twice as long it was so relaxing | | | already booked another stay for next year i enjoyed it so much | |last month my husband and i stayed at the intercontinental chicago while we were in town for imts | although they were very busy the service was excellent and very professional | the staff were always smiling and happy to help | intercontinental was conveniently located near michigan avenue and the best stores and restaurants in town | the view from our room was great | our room was always clean when we arrived home at night it was decorated nicely and the beds were extremely comfortable | we ate at the hotel's restaurant zest and the food was great | it was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while | we will definitely be back | |when you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport you areusually not in the best of mood | i working in a upscale hotel do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to | all they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in | the desk clerk who checked me in at this property did neither | she was short rude handed me my keys and walked away | i would never go back to this property due to this | |fairmont - i stayed at fairmont for a couple of days | though there was a long wait for check in the rest of the stay was great | the staff was friendly and helpful | i got the room on the tenth floor and had a great view of the city which looked even better at night | large size of the room and spacious bathroom made the room worth the money | their sushi bar is excellent and a must try | it was a good overall experience | |guys trip to chicago scored this hotel on priceline for $100 a night | had a little confusion over the bed situation at first | they said they only had kings available even after i had called and requested 2 doubles | after a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles | the room was nice nothing specacular a little on the small side but nice | the lobby was beautiful to look at but that's about it | hotel is within walking distance to soldier field sears tower espn zone and lots of bars and restaurants | great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip | would definately try and stay at this hotel again | |i was surprised by the fact that there were no extra sheets or blankets to make up the hide a bed | i called the desk and asked for some and they said that i couldn't have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed | my husband was ill and i wanted the bed set up so i wouldn't disturb him | but they were un moved and wouldn't bring the sheets | i ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket | they could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket i didn't pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress | seriously | lack of concern for the customer | |i had purchased this deal of off groupon | lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures | when we layed down to sleep in our bed | we lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed attached in photos we immediatly called the front desk | the only thing they offered was a new set of sheets | when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quickly/hid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again | we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean | then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos and they offered me a $68 refund | i was very dissapointedand dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and i broke out on my face with acne i never had a acne or skin issues im positive something in those dirtyy sheets | we drove 4 |5 hours to enjoy chicago and we stayed  the hard rock based on reputatuion and unfortunitly we were very disspointed | it was disgusting | i then wrote a email to management and heard nothing back | not even a response or apology | i just really expected alot more | |stayed here as a treat to myself while in chicago recently for a concert | i totally loved it here | | when you called either the front desk or room service the phone was answered with hallo mrs name which was a great personal touch | vanessa at the front desk went out her way to help me - storing some things in a safe for me before i could book into my room | my room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious | i was on the 30th floor and the views were superb | we ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice | the doormen were great too and i wore jeans and a tshirt one day and they still opened the door for me so no snobbery there | comfortable cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom the lights went on in the wardrobe never seen that before | | tv was hd ready and flat screen | the bed was like sleeping on a cloud - best sleep for a while | would i stay here again | | oh yeah | | no problem - just need to save up first | | |i try to stay at the james every time i happen to be in chicago | there are other good choices in town but nobody has what the james offers superior service - aka class meets efficiency - metropolitan design and comfort with an attention to details i found only at the w in seoul and what always plays a role meaning a convenient location  | | | then they get to you with small unexpected touches that make the difference ie i was about to take off and drive north it was a hot july day | | |one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water | a small gesture | unexpected and appreciated | the management and the staff understand what we expect and more importantly what we need | and they consistenly execute against that | |i stayed at the talbott twice in the last few weeks | i was very pleased with every facet of my stays | the staff from doormen to front desk to concierge to housekeeping were wonderful | the rooms were nicely sized and clean and well stocked | i will return to the talbott anytime | |amalfi hotel chicago - i stayed two nights at amalfi hotel during last weekend | one horrible incident really ruins everything in my trip | one morning i left my leather belt on the bed and when i got back after my breakfast my leather belt disappeared | i talked with the manager and they said the hotel was not responsible for the lost | clearly someone went into my room when i went out for breakfast and hotel people should be the only people have access to my room | hotel manager was not helpful and they didn't take the responsibility in this issue | |staff were friendly room was well kept like a typical hyatt location | hotel is huge with two buildings and over 2000 rooms | good location close to michigan ave and the subway | parking is $48/day | ouch | i bid on it on priceline for $59 | |we were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills | our room was such a pleasant surprise from the flat screen tv the full size shower with rain showerhead & hand held shower wand the wall attached toilet with flushing options on the wall the comfortable bed the lovely lighting options etc | | the size of the room was snug and very comfortable as would be in a historic hotel | it was also quiet and i know that the hotel was sold out | my sister was in the room next door | we did not hear her tv | we also loved walking less than a block to the shopping and restaurants on north michigan avenue | |james - i'm always surprised by the amount of value i get for staying here | i only had to pay $279 for the room but the value i get from this room is more than the amount i paid | the room was quite enjoyable to stay in | it's all the small things that the do correctly that make this hotel superior | the service housekeeping was fast but still handled with class | the amenities werenâŠ™t too fancy or flashy but it just got the job done | even though i have back problems the bed was firm enough that it didn't bother my back | i also ordered room service 1 night and got the roast of lamb | the red wine reduction needed more work but all in all it was a nice meal |  the best part of this hotel though is its view | with the $279 i spent i was able to get a room from the 49th floor and the view is just breathtaking | with it being in the center of chicago i was able to see almost all of chicago from there | all in all i would recommend staying here again | |my husband and i stayed at the conrad chicago on our 1st anniversary tripped and had a wonderful experience thanks to the staff | not only is the hotel and a great location with many places to eat and socialize within walking distance but they rooms were also clean and quiet | the staff was helpful and accommodated our requests | we'll definitely be staying here again next time we visit chicago | also if you stay you must eat at the restaurant | fabulous food | |we stayed at the ritz carlton two weeks prior and in comparison the sofitel does not come close | with the deal the ritz carlton is putting on right now stay two nights | | |get one free choose the nicer option | pros room service quick | 15 minutes tops | bathroom large bathroom with a separate shower and tub | lobby very impressive and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you | location close to the train station and mi ave | cons no top sheet | we asked the others at the conference they confirmed | | |there is no top sheet | you just sleep with the duvet cover over you | room -small and not a fan of the modern decor | -broken closet door the bottom track was bent | by the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so i could get to my things | -barely any storage closet was teeny tiny anyways almost no bigger than a tall locker only the top drawers of the nightstands open | -shower horrible water pressure | -the cleaning staff did not replace shampoo soap etc | had to call the front desk and they delivered within 10 mins | -the cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there realized this as i still noticed a stain we made the first night | i made sure not to leave the save the water card out | they changed our towels but not the bedding | | | -our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day | -they charge for wi-fi | -you can change the settings on the tv | | |brightness etc | |allegro - i have always had had a good experience with kimpton hotels and the allegro in chicago is no difference | their room is classy bright and spacious | i also got food credits with my reservation in their colorfully decorated cafeteria which featured excellent burgers and fries | will come back again a+ | |when my new fiance told me about his business trip to chicago i was quite annoyed | mostly because he insisted i come along | he made up for me so not wanting to come along and be alone all weekend with this wonderful hotel | his mother told him all about this hotel when she and her husband stayed here in the summer of 2008 | she loved it | |and so did i | i was so bummed about being all alone for most of the weekend but the decor wonderful staff and massages made up for it | i spent my time in the spa and the asian restaurant and couldn't have asked for a better experience | i am definately coming along on the next business trip | |the swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere | it was clean comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to check-in use the concierge check-out or report a problem to the front desk forget about it | i booked this place through priceline |com so i can't complain too much as i didn't pay a lot for the room but i have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another swissotel | it left a lot to be desired | the minibar fridge in my room didn't work so forget about a cold beer | also the internet/movie/guest services console didn't work so i had to go to the business office to access the internet | when it was time to checkout the console still wasn't working | it's better than the holiday inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel| |after reading some of the most recent reviews i'm really perplexed | i didn't know what to expect but i was most pleasantly surprised | just as all the past reviews both negative and positive have stated you can't beat the location of this hotel | it's perfect | we had a big spacious room in the old tower | we avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge | the beds were great the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly | great martinis in the hotel bar | i really can't understand the negative reviews | i know you can't please everyone but in some cases i simply don't believe their claims | i've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels | this is a great hotel | |have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted | great bar draught stella and guinness which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there good food lovely staff large clean rooms comfortable beds spot on location for the golden mile joey's pizzas next door are fantastic | ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please | highly recommended| |the talbott hotel - stayed at the talbott last weekend with some friends and it's fair to say that we were all disappointed in our stay | four of us stayed in a room with two queen beds and while we thought it would be enough space for all of us it was anything but that | the main room itself actually had a large amount of open floor space however it was actually too much space given what could've been provided | you'd think a room with that much space would have more useful furniture like usable table | the only furniture they provided were two arm chairs and two tiny side tables | all four of us were students yet not a single one of us could find an acceptable surface with which to do work on despite having ample floor space for a desk or table | the room is advertised for 2-4 people but the bathroom would not be able to support 3 adults let alone four | there was no space to move around the bathroom despite having two sinks essentially rendering parallel use in the bathroom absolutely useless | poor spacing/design by the architects | the in-house restaurant was also a bit disappointing it felt like all the effort went into the ambiance and decor but none went into finding decent chefs | the table they gave us in the corner of the resturant was a bit cramped as well | location was farther from the university of chicago than we would've liked but it was aleast close to washington square park | all-in-all the hotel is decent at best especially for the high price they charge | there are probably better options in chicago in my opinion | |my family chose to stay at the chicago hilton during our last trip to the city | we wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices | i can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the hilton | the staff treated us well the rooms were clean and roomy we loved the serenity beds and the hotel itself is stunning | it was like stepping back in time | we loved that the chicago hilton was close to numerous attractions | the weather was lovely so it was great to walk to navy pier sears tower and the adler planetarium | we will definitely stay at the hilton the next time we are in chicago | |stay away from this hotel | a few months back me and my wife decided to get out and have a nice pampered away from home weekend | looking at different options for this weekend we decided to go with the sheraton chicago hotel and towers | they claim  experience the extraordinary  and this sounded great | when we arrived at hotel we were met buy a closed front door and nobody to help with bags | the front desk clerk explained that our room was not yet ready and to goto the bar for some complemenatry drinks | after waiting 2 hours for our room we finally can start to relax | well upon entering room the smell of something horrible is overwhelming  | the front desk informed us there was no other rooms and they would bring up some air freshner | we packed our bags and headed over to x hotel and were able to get to our pampered weekend away from home | |i really wish i could say that i liked this hotel but the whole experience was just plain awful | my first warning sign should have been when i made my reservation | the person i spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing | at first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel i was actually wanting he booked me for the wrong dates | he read me the right dates and it was only when i called back two days later to confirm that i found out he'd given me the wrong dates | hilton did get it fixed but i already had a bad feeling about my stay | then came actually staying at the hotel | the people at the check-in desk were downright rude | then there was the room | i was supposed to be in a non-smoking room but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke | the hotel staff refused to believe me but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes | however i might as well have stayed in the first room | i was short towels and it took four callsover a period of 12 hours to the front desk to get some | the sheets had not been changed made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them | yes i was able to get fresh sheets but like the towels it took several hours for them to be delivered | since this is a pet friendly hotel lucky me i got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs | the walls were so paper thin all i could hear all night was barking | when i complained about it the staff refused to believe me and said that the walls of the room are so thick i shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door | yeah right | i was excited to use the pool but just like my room it hadn't been cleaned recently | then i tried the fitness center | half the equipment was broken | i tried to cut my stay short but of course this hotel wouldn't work with me at all | they even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness i had to deal with | i will never stay with hilton again and i will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was | |my husband and i recently stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for our wedding anniversary - and what a pleasant stay we had | from the first moment we walked in we were overwhelmed at the classy elegance of the lobby | i casually mentioned that it was our anniversary and after we came back from dinner we found champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room | the staff was professional but friendly and made us feel so welcome | the room was immaculate the furnishings were so plush - we didn't really want to go home | room service was prompt and the views were spectacular | we are definitely going to make this visit a yearly repeat | |the james chicago - the hotel was awesome and its location was fantastic | i really loved the service and the staff was very friendly | there were unlimited bath products bath robes free wifi and a great gym | i was glad to see good vegetarian options and the one i had was pretty delicious |i will certainly stay there again  | |i was lucky enough to get a 4 star hotel off of priceline for $70 - i was luckier that i got the knickerbocker | from check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly | the rooms are small but cozy | after reading the reviews from other guests i was somewhat scared of what i would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel | i am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the 4 star rating | yes the rooms and bathrooms were small but what historic hotel in a big city isn't | the decor and quality met my expectations | the lobby and bar were very inviting | overall i would stay here again and again | |my wife and i went to chicago to enjoy our weekend and stayed at hyatt regency | 'hyatt regency chicago' has ruined our family holiday weekend | first of all if you are not a diamond or platinum member you need to reserve the room atleast 10-15 days in advance | you have to pay extra $20 for the welcome credit option | they will give you a credit of $75 for the 2 days | we only used $20 and the rest was forefeited | i talked to the manager and he said we can't use it on our next visit | the management of the hotel is full of cheap minded people | when you know most of the hotels let you use their wi-fi for free hyatt regency management asked us to pay for using their wi-fi | beware of this place if you want to enjoy your weekend in chicago hyatt regency should be the last place you should consider staying | thanks sam | |reservation was for a king size bed instead i was given a double-bed room | check-in person must had a bad hair day because she was unfriendly | wall st journal or usa today is not complimentary | requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy | i didn't bother to file a formal complain because i was very tire | i travel often to chicago for business and the first will be the last at intercontinental | |the ambassador east hotel located in downtown chicago is one of the best hotels i've ever stayed in | my wife and i went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the ambassador east on a hotel booking website | their rates are very very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide | i was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and couldn't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend | i was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer which is nice because most places in chicago are very impersonal | all in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area | 5/5 stars | |we recently completed our first visit to chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the affinia chicago hotel where we stayed | the hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests including individual pillow choices complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visitand fine dining in two on-site restaurants one of them roof-top with amazing city views | i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago | |stayed over memorial weekend for 2 nites 2 rooms | great hotel we always love breakfast in morningand drinks in even when applicable | around the corner from magnificent mileand close to lots of restaurants | staff was great we even checked in early before noonand other room available less than hour later | fresh fruit was available to usand bell guys are cool | suites are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here house cleaning kept our room cleanand we felt safe | |upon entering homewood suites i was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel | when i saw my room i was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay refrigerator microwave stove dishwasher flat panel tv | best of all the hotel has an on-site fitness center where i was able to work off all of the extra calories i consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast | i couldn't resist their omelettes | the hotel is in the heart of chicago and i must say the city view from my room was priceless | definitely recommended | |no excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner | i wouldn't expect a cold shower at a budget hotel let alone an omni | great location and the bar is nice | |the omni chicago hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv's | the windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom | an in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay | there's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince | however the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use as well as the whirlpool jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool | sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks | a nice aspect that isn't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel | the omni chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation particularly when you don't want to be separated from your pet within the area | |we stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on trip advisor and yelp | we might have had a one in a million experience but we - were served a hairy salad a long black hair held a lettuce leaf hostage - considered our guest room tiny - could not submerge a thigh much less a body in the tub we're not obese and we're not dexter - endured a broken air conditioner for days it couldn't be repaired - experienced the delight of an inexplicably broken toilet they fixed it that day | on a positive note the tea from room service tasted delicious employees were abundant and friendly the location is great and it's very easy to get a taxi | in the future i would reluctantly stay here for business | i would not stay here for pleasure | i think a 20-something who hasn't traveled much would appreciate this hotel more than a seasoned traveler would | | |as a friend said to me today oh the sofitel | that's the hilton of france | i agree | |we were at the hotel allegro for an industry analyst event | i could not have expected worse | at first glance you figured it couldn't be too bad as a kimpton | the unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent | however the rooms just sucked | imagine your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size | cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that's also 1/3 the size | the building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell | the bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college | the paints peeling on the base boards the carpet is new but something is wrong | i would stay at the marriott renaissance westin or any where else | |traveled to this hotel on a family vacation | we chose this hotel because it was pet friendly | upon arrival we smelled just how pet friendly it was | the dog that greets you attacked my dog | there was constant barking throughout the night and during breakfast i found hair in my eggs | i would not recommend this hotel | |homewood suites chicago âŠ“ this hotel at first was great but quickly became a negative experience | when i stepped into my room i soon found that everything in the room was not cleaned up | all toiletries were not provided yet | also the food took 80 minutes to come out | | it was only a steak | |i loved this hotel | the room was so chic and trendy the bed was comfortable great slippers and robes | i love the keihl's bath products in the bathroom | we went during my birthday weekend and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room | we got a great deal on a junior suite from travelzoo but when we tried to take another trip to chicago the deal was gone | i really recommend the hotel | i loved it | the only problem we had was with the david burke steakhouse | the service was horrible they switched our order with the table next to our's and the only compensation was they took off a $7 side dish we ordered and they were nice enough to not charge us for the other side dish we didn't get | don't go there | go to the lawry's accross the street | but stay at the james | btw- its not a 3-star hotel like the website lists- its at least 4-star| |after some deliberation i booked the sofitel water tower place for a 3 night stop-over in june | this was my first visit to chicago and it turned out that we had a really great time | we loved our rooms which were just the basic type on the lower floors but they were very well appointed | the decor is modern and personally i liked it a lot | the rooms were pleasant and airy and the bed extremely comfortable | the hotel location is just perfect close to the shops on michagan avenue and the beach at oak street | lovely restaurants close by and nightlife in rush street is just steps away | the area although bustling was peaceful and quiet | we could walk to most places and i would not hesitate to stay here again | the hotel staff very helpful always smiling and ready to help from the doormen to the helpful lady at conceriage | i would not hesitate at all to stay at sofitel water tower place next time i'm in chicago in fact i look forward to my next visit | |the service was only subpar and then rooms needed better cleaning | i was at the check in counter longer than expected because they decided to use a trainee to check me in definitely no fun after such a long flight | there were no clean towels in the room and my bill was returned with room service charges of which i did not order | |my boyfriend and i decided to stay at the conrad chicago for our anniversary | the second we walked in we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room | white luxurous bedding on the king bed plasma t |v |/ subroofer/ surround sound speakers my boyfriend was more impressed than me as i reminded him that we didn't come to chicago for the hotel room very large bathroom w/ tub and separate stand-in shower granite countertops his/ her robes and slippers | the view wasn't great but we were on the 6th floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us | not a large room by any means but again  |  |  | we didn't go to the city for the hotel room | it was the prefect size for the amount of time we were actually in the room | we got a great rate on it $140 at hotels |com but i think the going rate is usually closer to mid $200's | i've stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one | we will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city | |the fairmont chicago-don't waste all | your money at the fairmont | we checked in after an exhausting day of travelling and the concierge staff were extremely rude and condescending to myself my wife and my daughters | to make matters worse construction and street noise from outside was so bad on the 12th floor no less | that we all had trouble getting to sleep despite a day of travel | upon awakening we discovered that the toiletries provided were not only far too small for a family of four but also so low-quality that i could have mistaken them for cvs generics | the saving grace of this hotel is its location--at least we were within walking distance of all the museums we came here to see | |i unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the knickerbocker hotel  | | |i should have checked out on day 1 | the bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawling | | |i pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheets | | |bed bugs | which i might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there fortunately i took photos to the contrary finding the bed bugs | | |i looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on both | | |i was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment | |i booked this hotel for a business trip since i was able to get a $129 rate on travelzoo and figured i'd save my company some money | i had also read excellent reviews on tripadvisor | i had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in november | when i arrived in chicago at 730pm i decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told no problem | when i arrived at the hotel at 1145pm i was told they didn't have a room for me and that i'd have to move to the four points sheraton which they paid for | it was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away | i was told that they overbooked and didn't get as many cancellations as they expected | i did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience | i would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late check-ins or you might not have a room | the experience designers were great and very helpful | the rooms were very nice and comfortable felt like home | the breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the healthy factor | it was nice that they did have fruit | i think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel--they just need to get the basics down | |my friend and i visited amalfi hotel last week when we were in chicago and found it to be a great place very sophisticated and luxurious with lots of attention to detail in the decor and wonderful customer service | the beds were comfortable | the room service was great as was the gym | | | i fully enjoyed the views from the hotel room | | | so beautiful at night | | | the city scape | and in the morning the free continental breakfast was delicious | it was a wonderful experience being at the amalfi hotel in chicago | i am eager to visit there again | |we stayed here for one night and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest | we found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this -  $200 for the night | we felt when we checked in that if you weren't with the conference then why were we staying in the hotel | the guy at the main door didn't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in | we were not given any information about the hotel and when i rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that i could access the internet through i was just short of being asked why didn't i bring my lap-top with me so i could use the internet access in the room | | | |  | | i found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist | |perfect location clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay | its in an area with plenty of stores  the mile and restaurants | hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall i would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family friends or on business | the subway to wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door | |i arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from california | i didn't know about the renovation when i made the reservations but that didn't bother me very much | i was helped by a man at the front desk named ben who was friendly enough but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay | he gave me no information about anything | i had no idea where breakfast was served or even if there was breakfast | there was also an extremely unpleasant woman working behind the deskshe wasn't wearing a name tag but was african american slim with short hair who seemed to be actually radiating hostility | it made me very uncomfortable and needless to say made me feel unwelcome | i actually felt like i was putting her out by staying in the hotel | i encountered her again the next morning when i had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness | i also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners | no matter what may be going on in one's life when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile | i was appalled by her demeanor | my room was alright there was no clock which i found very odd | since i came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and i was constantly confused as to which one was correct especially upon waking up in the morning | it would have been nice to have a clock | there was also no literature on local sites maps restaurant menus or even anything with the hotel's name and address in the room | also the mattress was the absolute worst mattress i've ever slept on in my life | i woke up every morning with a sore back and neck | i've had better sleep on a hard lumpy futon | it was absurd | like another person posted my tub did not drain either and i was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found | maybe they were around somewhere but i wasn't made aware of it at check-in and i didn't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like i was a burden to the employees | the hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance but i absolutely would not stay here again | i've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel which was a bummer because it was my first visit to chicago and i had pretty high expectations | |i had heard good things about the ambassador east and decided to stay there on vacation with my husband -- what a mistake | first off they charge for being able to use the internet which should be a given these days especially for how much you pay for the room | the champagne was cheap  i could have spent $15 to get my own bottle | the king room was just as small as a double room anyway | the bed was really hard and crudely made | maybe there was someone new on the staff that didn't know how to make a bed but besides that the sheets were starched to military stiffness | it was so uncomfortable | when i asked if we might get some new sheets the staff were so incredibly rude and told me i was basically stuck with what i had because they're all that way | i was appalled | anyway we gave it a shot and stayed there that night in the mediocre luster of the room design | we didn't sleep well and didn't particularly enjoy ourselves especially because apparently there was a wedding going on in the building because we could hear the party | i mean talk about the opposite of peaceful | again we tried appealing to the staff to have our room moved away from the party but they said they couldn't move us because of the romance package | what a jip | after the kind of fun we'd had we realized we couldn't handle anymore | we called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours | we wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay and he said he'd do that but that we'd still be charged a percentage of it | after telling him everything that had happened and how displeased we were we finally got him to not charge us and left to go stay at another hotel that was actually relaxing | |ambassador east - i had a really bad experience at this hotel | i stayed here with my girlfriend during christmas and their bed was horrible | it made some creaking noise and when we complained about this to the reception they said that they could not do anything about it | also the next day morning there was no hot water in the shower | they said there was some maintanance going on which would finish in half an hour hour | we waited for more than an hour and still no hot water | and the helpdesk was so rude that we did not even feel like talking to them | horrible place to stay  | | |ambassador east is an awesome hotel | | | understand that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel | my family stayed at the ambassador for two nights in a suite | very clean room with great space | the best part of the ambassador is not the rooms though | the staff was extremely courteous especially the concierge | if you stay here you have to go to the pump room | the restaurant is full of nostalgia the staff is great and the food is excellent | great atmosphere and music | |hyattregencychicago âŠ“ my stay at this hotel was rather miserable to say the least | while the service was timely the amenities were simply not up to par | first the two queen beds in the room were in decrepit condition | moreover they only had two small pillows on each bed | we had to request more | the bathroom was small and it took us forever to locate the hair-dryer which turned out to be in the closet which makes no sense | i suppose the tv was nice but we have a nice tv at home | perhaps the worst of all was the lack of a pool | many other hotels in the area offer a nice pool which i believe are a staple of any good hotel | the breakfast was cold and bland | moreover they stopped service early which was disappointing since they really should adhere to the times that they posted | overall my stay was not up to snuff and i would certainly look for a different hotel next time we go to chicago | |the hotel allegro located in the chicago loop provided my wife and i with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory | we ordered the weekend liquid therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website but to our surprise when we arrived our names were nowhere to be found in their system | no room no accommodations at the restaurant nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot | a weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than i originally booked and never did they offer us a replacement dining option | i have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time | we will never be staying here again | |our trip was our annual anniversary trip | the hotel did not honor my choice of king size bed | instead we received two double beds | this seriously decreased our enjoyment of our stay at the hyatt | there were two cups of coffee complimentary in the room | no complimentary coffee anyplace else in the very large hotel | location was more of a business district not appropriate for pleasure trip | employees of hyatt were very friendly and helpful other than the failure to deliver the reserved room | |the hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night | for three consecutive nights | there was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street ok - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor | i hesitate to write this review but i rely on trip advisor reviews when traveling and had i been warned about the ambulance sirens i would have chosen to stay elsewhere | if you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value | conveniently located | wonderful staff | but quiet is a key priority for me so i would not stay here again | |though grand and having a brand this hotel seems to disappoint me on certain fronts | 1 | staff seemed snooty and arrogant | 2 | request for upgrade was fulfilled only after repetitive requests |the initial room was very small | 3 | for the cost paid i would expect a coffee maker free internet service at the least which even regular b&bs offer | 4 |they will levy charges on each and everything |complete rip off other things matched the grandeur |cleanliness and location was good but the staff made my stay unpleasant | |as i walked into the hotel i was greeted warm heartedly | they took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly | i was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom | also i was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient | overall i was very happy with my stay at this hotel | |location is excellent but don't valet your car there53 |00 a day | bed was to soft pillows were flat we couldn't open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way | all in all not what you'd expect from a hotel in that area | |my husband three year old son and i arrived at the palmer house hilton last friday for a weekend stay | the hotel looked elegant online but included information that also indicated it was child friendly | at the check in the staff was cold and seemed quite annoyed by son who was merely saying hi and asking the name of the person helping us | one elevator was broken we had a long wait for other elevator | the hallway appeared a bit dirty as we made our way to our room | the room was decent | not deluxe as their website indicated it would be but is was comfortable and the view was good | we had a long day of sight seeing and play on saturday | as my son was tired we elected to return to our room and have room service for dinner | there was no children's menu for room service | only for the restaurant from which the room service came from the same kitchen what | | | we ordered an adult meal | the food arrived an hour later cold and unappealing | but we at it because we couldn't wait another hour | although the hotel looks lovely | the service was not very good | most of the staff was cold and snooty | except for the cleaning staff who were very nice | it might be ok for a couple or business traveler but do not stay with children | a comfortable motel might be better | |ambassador east - i and my friends had been for an outing last weekend and stayed at the ambassador east for one night | it is situated right in the middle of the city with a view of the ocean | the view is amazing and the location is very close to the shopping center and other attractions of the city | the hotel has all the amenities required apart from the well maintained spacious suites | the staff was also helpful and quick in providing room service | i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago | it would also be a great venue for meetings and weddings as they have amazing facilities for the occasions | |intercontinental chicago magnificent mile - while the interior decorating in the rooms was gorgeous it was only redeeming quality i could find in the magnificent mile hotel | the rooms were cramped and tiny the mattress was hard and one of the staff members gave me attitude when i asked for turndown service | such a beautiful hotel but service and comfort are not something that can be found here | |palmer house a hilton hotel - this hotel was not worth the rate that i received | the hotel has a great location but there are numerous improvements that should be made | first they should have more staff on hand | i experienced unexpected wait times both when checking in and at the hotel's bar | also it took about an hour for my room service to arrive | the hotel has great potential but try should hire more staff | |my girlfriends and i stayed at the hyatt in chicago during a shopping trip to the city in june 2010 | we found a great deal on orbitz |com and decided to give it a try | the location was perfect just off michigan avenueon the chicago river so it was easy to walk down the mag mile and get to all of the shops without having to pay for cabs or rent a car | the hotel is right next the the palm restaurant and within walking distance of several places to eat both fancy china grill yum |and affordable corner bakery | the rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious | we were lucky to get a room with a good view | | |be sure to ask that you do not have a view of the office building next door | the lobby is typical hyatt big and spacious with lots of plants | service was good | all around an excellent experience and a great deal | |intercontinental - stayed here for a week and did not like it much | there was a long wait for check in | my room was on the second floor and the view was blocked by building around the hotel |  room was of decent size but bathroom was too small and had a weird smell | i ordered room service which took much longer than expected and the menu did not have much variety and the staff is not very pleasant |  i would not recommend this hotel |  it is definitely not worth the money | |the omni chicago hotel is a very high quality hotel | this hotel is a very comfortal and high tech place to relax | it has everything you could possibly want to relax workout and feel luxurious | a must stay at hotel i give it five stars | |i have stayed at the amalfi hotel before and it has always been excellent | this time was no different | usually i book direct with the hotel however i found a slightly better deal booking through expedia which saved about $100 | the staff were great | i arrived early and they had a room waiting | i was placed on the 6th top floor and it was quiet and comfortable | overall it was as good as it gets | i will definitely continue to stay here when i'm in chicago | remember the hotel is close to everything - downtown the magnificent mile lots of restaurants etc | everything is within walking distance | |i took the wife and kids to chicago for one last fling before school started back up | when i checked in the staff was very attentive i showed a little consideration for the friendly attitude small tip and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar | i didn't get the priceline glare and it paid off for all involved | the air and water show was underway on the lake front and we had planes flying over our room | the kids thought it was great | that night we had a great view of the fireworks at navy pier | the sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason | the conceirge was very knowledgeable and very friendly | it was one of the best times we ever had in chicago | |after considering several hotels in the area my family and i finally decided unfortunately on homewood suites for our long weekend vacation | overall the experience left much to be desired | the breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries | the linens on one of our beds seemed dirty and when i told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude | i would not come back here ever | |millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago - i must say i was disappointed with my stay here |  i'm currently on crutches due to a recent foot injury and was hoping to get a room close to the elevator |  i guess most of the rooms were unavailable but the man at the front desk was very rude to me when he explained they were unable to make special accommodations |  apparently i am supposed to be clairvoyant and make such requests in advance |  anyway to get to my room i had to make a right out of the elevator and walk down a hallway turn left and walk down another hallway and turn left again and walk down yet another hallway |  my room itself was nothing special |  i had trouble sleeping due to poor air circulation and a stiff mattress |  the bathroom was also just okay and on the smaller side |  one of the bathroom lights was burnt out and it took them 3 days to replace the bulb |  needless to say i was not impressed and would not recommend this place | |sofitel-chicago-water-tower - we just came back from a trip to chicago where we stayed at the hotel for two nights | we just wanted to explore chicago area so we picked this hotel because it has easy access to public transports bus subway airport | all is well until we were shown our room | when we made a reservation we insists on having the room with lake view | we got the exact opposite | i raised the issue and got to talk with the manager whoâŠ¦ like his subordinate is less than willing to listen to our concern and we had to give up | our next complaint is the bathroom | why would you need the bathroom to be that big | | we brought some friends in chicago over to hang out and we were jam-packed in the bedroom and it feels very small while the bathroom is virtually empty | bad use of space | the restaurant at the first glance seems nice with cozy big red sofa and high ceiling and has a nice selection of menu | the problem is when the food actually got served | it was unbelievably cold as if it's prepared in advance | the waiter and the manager again did not seem to be genuinely sorry about that | on the following days we left early and came back late because there was nothing we could enjoy inside the hotel | terrible experience | | | |the james chicago-my wife and i had an excellent stay at the james |  we stayed at one of their marvelous 1 bedroom apartments which were much more affordable than we expected |  the wife loved that there was a wet bar and that the bathroom was so large |  i enjoyed that the living room was separate from the bedroom so that i could watch tv late at night while she slept |  everything was clean and well kept i would recommend it highly | |monaco - last week my family stayed at the monaco for two nights while visiting my brother in chicago |  though we went in not knowing what to expect going off the suggestion of a friend we were pleasantly surprised at the amenities the hotel provided |  our rooms were very spacious with plenty of furniture to lounge around with your kids |  the bathrooms were kept clean and the staff helped us out with figuring our way around the city |  there are frequent shuttles to and from o'hare so getting there was a breeze too |  i also recommend seeing a show at the chicago shakespeare theater while you're staying since its not too far from the hotel | |intercontinental - stayed here for a week and loved it | my room was on fifth floor which has a great view | very pleasant staff big rooms and bathrooms | everything was clean and fresh | it is close to navy pier shedd aquarium and shopping center which is an added plus point |  i ordered in room service and though it took a little longer than expected the food was great especially the roasted alaskan salmon |  it was a good overall experience and if i get a change i would definitely stay here again | it is worth the money | |the intercontinental chicago is located in the heart of downtown chicago illinois on north michigan avenue the magnificent mile | this hotel is located within moments not minutes from the navy pier millennium park and magnificent mile shopping | the intercontinental chicago boasts a modern fitness center that feature free weights a cardio room dry saunas as well as masseurs | when business knocks at your door the hotel has a 24 hour business center providing high-speed internet access fax and photocopying services | the accommodations at the intercontinental chicago are elegant with a touch of historic decor | the room had a breath-taking view of chicago as well as had an in-room mini-bar terry-cloth bath robes over-sized desks high-speed internet access and a 37-inch hi def lcd television | not only was the overall quality of the property in stunning condition the staff at the intercontinental chicago were welcoming caring and demonstrated a profound customer-service base | |http//www |amalfihotelchicago |com/ - i was very disappointed by the amalfi hotel | the hotel is inconvieniently situtated far from public transportation | if you don't bring a car you will need to take expensive taxis if you actually want to do anything in chi town | on the flip side the rooms are decent and the food was good though not enough to offset the location | overall a disappointment | |what a quaint warm and friendly place to stay | very accomodating  | |had 2 dble beds and bathroom was fine | | | |a bit small compared to usa hotels | | | |but compared to european travel | | |the place was palatial | would def | stay here again | location is great too | |whatever you do do not stay at the homewood suites in downtown chicago | i made that mistake and it was terrible | the bed linens were obviously not clean - there was even a stain on the comforter - and the housekeeping staff there absolutely did not care about doing a good job | our room was only cleaned twice in a week's stay and even then only the barest minimum of effort seemed to go into it | they didn't even empty the trash cans | as for the in-suite kitchen it was awful | we were hoping to save money by cooking in our room but with one broken eye on the stove and a nasty greasy microwave | it seemed a better idea to eat out and avoid any more unpleasant surprises from their lackluster in-house food | i didn't hear good things about their breakfast offerings anyways | if i were you i'd avoid this place like the plague | i know i'm certainly never going back | |the palmer house hilton was recommended to me by a friend who had visited chicago the previous summer | i was very happy with the location  and was able to visit the nearby lake michigan and millennium park beautiful | | | the rooms were good size  and the right amount of luxury for the price | i didn't use room service much  but when i did everything was in order | |my husband and i came to the ambassador east hotel for my sister's wedding | the hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests | when we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were helping us check and get our guests situated | they were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest's rooms | our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed with a view of the city | we held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall | after my sister was married in a church downtown we held the reception in the large banquet hall | again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner the dj and all of the wedding's decorations | we had a great time | ambassador east hotel is highly recommended | |i got a sunday night stay for only $50 off of priceline |com so it would be hard to complain | | |but this was truly a great hotel even if i paid double | the first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the hyatt regency chicago is wow | the lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant plenty of couchesseats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains | you take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area | the hotel let me check in at 12pm i had a 3pm check in time | i suggest you call ahead like i did so they know you are coming early |the women at the desk was friendly and when i requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me i have a room on the 18th floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view | i thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that i wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall | the rooms are big i had a doubles room the beds were beautiful with great pillowsblanketsheadboards etc | an ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room | great to plug in your ipod listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring chicago | the view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries | another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport | you simply look at the screen click on your airline icon and following the instructions | i had my boarding passes in about a minute | came in handy when i got to ohare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers | i was only in the hotel for 1 day but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences i have had and i travel alot | it is a business hotel but definitely a great choice for families and couples | definitely would stay here again when im passing through chicago | |swissotel - there are some hotels that you should avoid and this is one of them | although i specified a non-smoking room the stench of cigarettes assaulted me as i entered | after complaining i was put in another room | this took almost an hour as the front desk was understaffed and i had to wait in line | worse still the room i was transferred to had a broken tv | by this time i was too tired to complain and simply went to bed | at least the bathrooms were clean although i thought the bed smelled a bit weird | i couldn't sleep well at all though due to the noise from the street | overall a terrible experience | |omni chicago hotel – my family stayed here for a quick half-week vacation last month | we booked through travelocity and got a good deal for the quality a bit over $200 a night | wow | the rooms are -big- it felt a bit wasteful getting a second room for my 2 daughters but they loved it and had a blast | the rooms are well furnished and well maintained and the height of the hotel gives a great view over surrounding buildings | we ate at the restaurant for one meal and have to say it had a good selection try the braised beef but eat out cause theres so much within 2 blocks of the hotel | also head down to the navy pier if you have the time | the hotel will drive you and the painted glass museum impressed me let alone the kids | my only regret is that we didn’t stay longer | fun times and a good hotel | |allegro - i had a reservation at the allegro in chicago and this was honestly the worst reservation i have ever made | the rooms were small had an odor and the location was far away from chicago's otherwise convenient public transit | book your stay somewhere else if you can | |when you're standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again | the worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem they told me that it happens to the upper floors and i wasn't even staying on the highest floor | as if that makes it ok | i can look past the rustic decor of the room and take it for what it is - an inexpensive place to crash but c'mon a girl's gotta shower | |sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel even if you tried | such was the case with sofitel where we'd never stayed before | it's a sleek modern sophisticated hotel with european touches | we spent three days there on a leisure weekend we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the hancock building at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night | the room was average sized well-appointed everything in it worked and it had a fabulous view of the chicago high-rise jungle including snippets of the lake | the public areas were wonderfully decorated | the restaurant served a good breakfast at for chicago reasonable prices | the staff was excellent | my wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches | the staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her | |the hotel is excellently situated for visiting the art institute or millennium park | it is an old classic of a hotel and the main lobby is a must see but i would not stay there again | the problem with any hotel dating from long ago the current one was built in 1923-25 is that even with extensive remodeling which was done in 2007-2009 it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much | we had a reasonably sized room king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries | also there was no coffee machine in the room - something i have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days | my major complaint about this stay was the executive lounge | it is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price | since we are currently at the diamond level in the hilton honors program we get access for free at the hiltons but i usually upgrade at other chains such as the hyatt | at the palmer executive lounge i ordered a couple of glasses of wine there was a bartender on duty and was slightly surprised by the cost - $9/glass which came to $21 |44 for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine | it was about the worst wine i had tasted in many years | i didn't think it was even as good as trader joe's cheapest $2 |99 wine that i tried a couple of weeks ago | unfortunately i didn't get a look at the bottle to see what it was although i did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard | i noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and i can understand iot at the prices they were charging | it then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time | i checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar | the cabernet was a william hill at $10 |50/glass from room service | i presume that what i had had at some time been a william hill that had been left to turn to vinegar | it was slightly more expensive from room service but i hope that it was in a lot better condition | |while the james was once considered an elegant chic establishment it has lost its luster | the small rooms are filled with cheap ikea type furnishings our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain | showers and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing | the 2 small elevators could not handle the guests and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time | the thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night | it was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing but also rather tacky & unsettling | it took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out | this hotel has lost it and the james sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in new york's soho when they try to open in september | new yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence | |negative points 1 | i guess they gave me the worst room | it's small room with a king size bed even though i'd requested a room with two queen beds | 2 | no roll away bed was available so i had to sleep on the floor | 3 | the tub in the bathroom would not drain | 4 | no exhaust fan in the bathroom | 5 | broken furniture | plus point 1 | convenient location | |i have recently stayed at the hyatt regency chicago hotel and although i have stayed there a variety of times before for both business and pleasure my experience this time was particularly poor | from right when i checked in to the day i left i felt like i was constantly around unfriendly people who didn't want to be at work their to do their jobs | my room was dirty the whole time even though the maid came every day and when i was trying to sleep at night it was so loud in the hallways i couldn't sleep | for my next visit to chicago i won't be staying at the hyatt regency | |while visiting the chicago area we chose the hotel monaco chicago for our stay | as one of the premier luxury hotels in chicago we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved | the problems began as soon as we arrived | the attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of kimpton | and when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for the situation only got worse | rather than apologize for the error my credit card receipt was on hand we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms | i could not believe that a top 40 u |s | hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder | with no choice but to retreat back to our room we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay | a beautiful hotel in the chicago loop but don't go expecting to be treated with respect or professionalism | |my wife and i recently stayed at the hotel monaco in chicago and after our experience there we will not be returning | with a hotel that markets itself as luxury we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck | we were disappointed to say the least | first of all we stayed in the king deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small | the space was used poorly - my wife and i could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space | the decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality | although they said our room woudl be ready at 3 we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready | although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology they didn't seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused | the noise at night from the city is horrible - even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight | the hotel would not move us to a different room | all in all i felt that we paid $100 |00 for a luxury hotel and got a $40 motel 6 | we will definitely not be back anytime soon | |we traveled to chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city | to our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations | gone is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one | | | elevator that is working to the second floor to register | our first room was recently renovated | | | | |stark white walls no amenities at all | guests had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room | modern furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair | no fride coffee maker iron or even a picture on the stark white walls | we asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the 15th floor | while this room was attractive we were greeted to jack hammers at 8 every morning | the staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking | lake shore drive| |i read the reviews on trip advisor for this property which had it ranked as #1 in chicago | i got a king room overlooking michigan ave | the view was beautiful | the room was also impeccable | nice and bright very fresh and modern | i find it very hard to fault any sofitel's | the service attentiveness of staff cleanliness and luxury are always top notch | location was great head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe's and restaurants | straight ahead of the hotel on michigan ave is a shoppers paradise | a great place to stay and much better value than park hyatt | i do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy such as for the internet | when you are paying top dollar a few inclusions would be nice | |palmer house a hilton hotel - the palmer house is a terrible place to stay at | while the hotel may look nice the food is horrible | during my first night's stay i tried to take a bath in my room's bathroom and saw a spider crawl out from underneath the faucet | i will never stay here again | |my $200 gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th | i filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them | this was such a disappointment as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in chicago | our room was really nice with 2 bathrooms | we had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed | we had a great view of the lake and park | the hotel charged us $25 to check in early 10am | |i was in business in chicago so i decided to choose what i thought would be a relaxing hotel to treat myself a bit | i should have known when the woman at the front desk rolled her eyes when i asked for some of the complimentary apple cider advertised | she told me it's by the signs in a you-idiot kind of voice | too bad the signs were too far away from me to read without my glasses | i was ashamed and did not ask for anything from the front desk again | the room itself was horribly decorated and nothing special | the i'm too ugly to steal furniture patterns and colors did not say luxury to me | i went down to relax by the pool with my laptop to get some work done | unfortunately the pool was overrun with about five rowdy kids | no parents in sight | i would have reported them to the front desk but was shamed by the aforementioned apple cider incident | thank god i left my laptop in its case or it would have been ruined by all of the water that was splashed on me | the free breakfast tasted like cardboard it was something akin to a free breakfast at a $60-a-night hotel | i only tried it once because it made me feel sick when i ate it | the only good thing about my experience was leaving this overpriced motel behind to go to work | |the name conrad the most luxurious of all hilton hotels should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury however the conrad in chicago il did obviously not receive the memo | upon entering the hotel we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff | additionally we were not offered any help | the desk receptionist was beyond rude | her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay | after getting our card we were finally offered help with our luggage | the young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage | strangely he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip | he received the tip he deserved which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away | upon first looking at the room it was beautiful | however closer inspection revealed that the room had not been cleaned since the last visitor had left | there was hair in the sink and around the toilet | there was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub | this fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff | instead i was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards | two-hours later someone came into the room to investigate | when they saw the mess that had been left they offered a menial apology | still another two hours later housekeeping arrived | the level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage | in the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit the valet actually brought the wrong car to me | i was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me it was certainly an incredible make and model but my better judgment prevailed | i informed the valet of his mistake to which he replied sorry dude i read your ticket wrong | i know that he did not smoke in my car but he smelled so strongly of smoke that the smell melted into my seat | luckily its location on rush will help get out of the terror that is conrad chicago | there are so many better hotels in chicago -- please spend your money elsewhere | |palmer house a hilton hotel – i had a business trip to chicago last week and i decided to stay at the palmer house after reading the online reviews | since i was the only one travelling and i was going to be at the office most of the time i decided to take a single bed guest room | it was a bad decision | the single bed guest rooms were small there was hardly any place to walk | even the bathrooms were smaller than the average hotel bathroom | even though i came to the hotel only to spend my evenings and nights my 3 day 4 night long stay at the hotel was disastrous | the beds were not comfortable and i was tired in the morning even after a good 8 hours of sleep | although the room service and dining is decent the quality of the rooms left a bad impression of the hotel in my mind | this place seems to be good only if you stay in the executive luxury suits which i hope is bigger than my room | palmer house was a huge disappointment and i will not be staying here if i ever visit chicago again | |i loved it here | my boyfriend and i booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our 3 nights here | i've paid more to stay at the santa barbara motel 6 | | gorgeous hotel great staff fun bar/lounge area and we were most impressed with the room | the large windows in the bathroom were the best--i took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of navy pier and the skyline | i remember thinking this is really living | | | the room was comfortable and quiet again with great views just like in the bathroom | chicago is a wonderful town--i have nothing but good things to say about it | can't wait to come back | |i have traveled to chicago many times for business and so i have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons | there was nothing dramatically wrong the sheraton but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel | it almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs | the carpets were old there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom towels and linens were older than i expected the rooms were in need of some redecorating etc | during the week i was paying $349 per night for a room and it simply was not near the quality i expected for that price | one positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good | plenty of aerobic machines with tvs weights etc | location is also quite good perhaps the reason for the high price with close walks to michigan avenue and the river | in summary i think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown chicago | |i only stayed here for five days but i will definitely never be going back | the architecture is kind of cool but the customer service was very poor | i don't know how much these people get paid but they must not think it is enough | breakfast at the the continental was alright but it was overpriced | this hotel felt really crowded and the service was impersonal | there are many better places to stay in chicago | |recently i traveled to chicago for a business conference and was lucky enough to stay at the hyatt regency chicago | the whole experience was wonderful | the room was spacious and beautiful and the bed was so comfortable that i had no problem falling asleep as i normally do at other hotels | the staff were polite and courteous and after a delicious breakfast in the restaurant i went to my conference with a smile on my face | |the millennium hotel knickerbocker sounds fine and the website is pretty but the reality is an over-hyped overpriced reality-isn't-as-good-as-fantasy package | the catering they offer is a joke you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the chicago area | while the rooms were cleaner than most there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses and when i called to complain about it a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off | the rooms look small but cozy when you book online but when you get there in person you realize just how tiny they are | trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did i mention that it smelled like cleaning solution | i also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is | in fact it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small you'd get better prices and a far better room from the hilton | |we stayed here through hotwire and got an amazingly low rate- $60 some odd dollars nightly for a 2 night stay last may | the room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel but it was very clean tastefully decorated and cozy | we had a great vacation walking all over town until we ended up near the planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of chicago and were just wow | so anyway the hotel is great the service was great the room was very nice- i would recommend this hotel to anyone though i work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person's comment about how she wasn't able to get adjoining rooms well internet sites don't guarantee things like that anyway- you've got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that | there's a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type/location is guaranteed | 5 stars out of 5 for this hotel | |the millennium knickerbocker hotel has seen better days | i had fond memories of staying there when it was considered the finest hotel | i booked a room to celebrate a special occasion and found a highly-priced not so great property | i had to look at five suites before i found one where the upholstered furniture was to my liking some of the other rooms carpet was not clean the refrigerator was dripping water and the balcony was littered with cigarette butts | i finally settled for a room only because the bellman was friendly and apologetic but as over priced as it was i should have turned around and walked out | i sent a letter to the management when i returned home but it had been a month and i never received an answer | there are plenty of other places to spend your money | don't leave it at this hotel | |i went to stay in the millenium hotel chicago | now first being from rural midwest i was surprised at the price in general but kind of accepted it when i was assured by my cousinwhom i was visiting in chicago said it was normal | so i check in service seems fine | i get checked in room seems ok | a couple of hours later a lady comes into my room not a hotel employee just some lady | turns out they cross checked the rooms | weher and i went down and complained | turns out they double booked the room not that they were full but they were full on that room type standard as well as the superior rooms | rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to move up | we argued with them for 20 minutes they didn't budge our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $60 for a corner superior | wethe lady her name was sharon decided to split the difference some she gave me $20 and i moved | i get to the new room about 20 minutes later nobody but sharon helped me move | i get there the bed was thrown together not made and the bathroom wasn't clean the garbage had a kleenex in iti wasn't going to check if it was used | i called down it was now 5pm | no answer i called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone | i told them about the state of my room | they said they would have someone up right away | i waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in not in uniform but she did a hell of a job cleaning | she switched out the garbage wiped out the whole bathroom vaccuumed around me and switched out the bedding all told she was in and out in 10 minutes | she didn't say two words to me but she did clean | i stayed the night and checked out a 7am and will never go back | ryan from iowa| |i live in chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances | we recently put up a candidate and his family we were recruiting for our company at the conrad | we had had good luck with this hotel when it was a le meridien | it was a disappointment for all concerned as a conrad | on the plus side our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room | on the downside | | | they learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub only a shower | our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it which they had to clean themselves | when the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some they were told it would be delivered immediately | when they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had forgotten | while the concierge and doorman were quite helpful our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive | our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the five best hotels in chicago | conrad has a long way to go to compete with the four seasons peninsula and park hyatt | |very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view | the dinning selection is one of the best i have seen in chicago | i have stayed many places downtown chicago and nothing matches this | i am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well | the shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors | the biggest thing that i have to say is that the customer service was great with everything that i needed | i give the hotel a 5 out of 5 | |i have stayed in the talbott a few times and had always liked it | this time was my first visit in 2 years and i was disappointed | the hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced | i had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window | the lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright | the bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room | the ac unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off | having stayed there before i know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others i have been in and the risk is getting it again | other small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee so you couldn't walk out with the coffee and i got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay | the construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7 |30am and goes on until around 8pm including weekends | |sheraton chicago - i booked the sheraton hotel after i read all the good reviews about it on tripadvisor and i would say the hotel is truly outstanding as it was described | the check-in was really easy and the staff were very welcoming and gave me a lake view room on the 10th floor |i was amazed at how spacious and delicately decorated the room was when i walked in | it was also such a nice surprise that the coffee machine actually provides starbucks coffee | the bathroom was large and clean and the shampoo and conditioner provided were very really nice | it's a little annoying that the wifi needs extra charge per day but sometimes that's just inevitable | the location of this hotel makes it very convenient to almost go anywhere you want | it is located at the heart of downtown chicago and within walking distance to navy pier magnificent mile millennium park art institute the loop district perfect for a new visitor to the city | the dining at sheraton was also great | i especially enjoyed the steak and wine at the shula's i would say one of the finest in the country | overall sheraton is a great hotel for anyone visiting chicago and i would definitely recommend it to all my friends | |stayed at this hotel for labor day weekend and it was pretty awful | the staff were relatively friendly but that's where the positive aspects stop | bed was rock hard and very uncomfortable | thermostat didn't work properly and the air conditioner was always 5 degrees warmer or colder than what you wanted | even though i think $10 for 1 day of internet is ridiculous i bought it because i needed to download a powerpoint for work and send off a few emails | it was ungodly slow and barely better than dialup | i ended up finding a starbucks to use their wifi so i could actually get something done | minibar was overpriced as expected | awful experience definitely wouldn't stay here again | |amazing and beautiful | i stayed two nights here and the room was immaculate | all of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming | the food was delicious and fixed to perfection | the entire hotel was clean warm and inviting | will definitely stay here again and recommend to any of my friends traveling to the area | |i have recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park and the visit was most unpleasant | this hotel was loud and the staff was very rude | all the fancy lights and designs are just a distraction from the snobby people who stay there and the people who work there that seem to hate their jobs | the hotel food was old it seemed like they were making it all at once for all the people staying there | the beds were hard and uncomfortable and it was an over all bad experience in what looked like a nice place to spend a vacation| |my wife and i's stay at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers proved to be the perfect complement to our time spent visiting and exploring the windy city | upon our arrival we were immediately welcomed by the beautiful design of the first-floor lobby and the friendly demeanor of the desk and bell service staff | in seemingly no time at all we were in our clean and well-furnished room with a beautiful and peaceful view of lake michigan | in terms of accommodations i have never personally stayed at a hotel that i could complement more | on our very first night my wife took advantage of a message therapy session while i swam a few laps in the heated indoor swimming pool | we followed our time apart with a very relaxing time at the chi bar which had a very enlivening and laid-back atmosphere | retiring to our rooms i couldn't help but remark to my wife about the quality of our room and the bed in particular | i had a very comfortable night's sleep and woke up just on time thanks to a spot-on wake up call from the desk staff | after a quick bite to eat the lb bistro we headed out to sight-see | overall i can't recommend the sheraton chicago hotel and towers enough | as far as this customer is concerned it is the only place to stay if you are in the chicago area and are looking for accommodations with the best customer service atmosphere and amenities | i couldn't recommend it more | |the palmer house hilton is located in the heart of the theatre financial and shopping districts of downtown chicago | it is walking distance to museums shopping government and corporate buildings | the location makes it perfect for visiting chicago | the rooms are luxurious with super comfortable beds and soft sheets | the rooms was clean and quite nice looking | the hotel's restaurants are amazing | the hotel would definately exceed your expectations whether you are a business traveler or there on vacation | |i stayed at the talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased | the staff was friendly as can be immediately confirming the lore of the midwest | i was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious | the free wi-fi came in handy as i needed to work remotely while there | everything from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay | oh and i got to workout at the huge equinox right next door for free | |the talbot hotel is an elegant place to take you wife or husband for a weekend getaway | the personally yours romantic package was fabulous | upon check in we opened our room door and found a romantic atmosphere | there was rose pedals and luxurious bathrobes | we felt like it was our honey moon all over again | |this hotel was an absolute dream to stay in | i couldn't have picked a better hotel to spend in such luxury | i enjoyed the set up of the rooms and the space they offered |the room decor was extremely elegant and the location was great as well | i honestly felt like i was at a spa | the price was very reasonable as well | i would definetly recommend this hotel to everyone i know | if you ever get a chance to spend a night here definetly choose the suite rooms | | | |it's so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website claiming said deal is available on certain dates | but when you call to make a reservation based on that deal they tell you it's not available | there are rooms available but not the deal | then they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal | i get that | then just say that on the website | here's a great deal  |  |  | but only a small number of people will actually get it | so much for the great reviews about service  |  |  | i couldn't even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed | bad form conrad bad form | |the intercontinental chicago magnificent mile the outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city | for the cost of the rooms starting at 179 |00 a night you would think they would have a competent parking attendant | i was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room and if that was not enough | to top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork | needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account | i would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations | |amalfi hotel chicago - concierge was extremely pleasant and helpful | the room was spacious and the beds were super comfortable better than my bed at home | one thing i was not happy with - one of the glass cups they provided was not cleaned very well | i usually never use the in-room glasses just for that reason so i called and had them bring some paper cups | other than that absolutely no complaints | the free wi-fi was much appreciated for keeping up with emails etc | not to mention the beautiful view | |warning food poisoning alert | | | the room was dirty the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on | the elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it | they hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for | what was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick | the one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue | the second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer | do not stay here| |it was my first time to visit chicago and i would say i'd definitely go back not just because of the air and water show that we really enjoyed but most importantly because of the hotel that we stayed in | the millennium knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests but with pets too | at first i was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog but i was surprised it turned out the other way | i've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that's really frustrating it's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly | i would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit chicago | |james hotels ---  the hotel was a nice place to stay | i was amazed by the beautiful interiors and the fact that they allowed pets | next time i wont have to leave my pet at home | the one bedroom apartment i stayed in was spacious and comfortable not to forget the relaxing bathroom | most importantly i did not miss my gym | your gym had almost everything i needed | next time i would love to explore more into your menu of services | i enjoyed shopping around the magnificent mile | while leaving chicago i had a flight early morning which i had informed the staff earlier | they gave me a wake up call and even packed me breakfast for the journey which was quite fresh and tasty | their audi cab facility i must say was quite a relief | i will recommend the lake hotel to my company hr for any business visits to chicago | thanks for the wonderful stay and food | |i had a great experience staying at the conrad chicago the service was top notch the price was good but out of everything the service was outstanding | i would definitely stay there again when in the area and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good quality hotel in a great location | right next to the shops at north bridge | |i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker for 3 nights while on a business trip as it was conveniently located a few blocks away from the office i was visiting and just about everything else for that matter | the lobby was absolutely beautiful and the staff was beyond courteous and extremely helpful | the rooms were elegant and spacious and i instantly felt right at home | the large flat screen tv as a nice touch and tv options were many | i headed downstairs to the bar for a drink and was amazed at how well kept it was as well as how nice everybody was | as this was my first time i asked the bartender about the area around and he gave me great advice about some places to check out | all in all this was a great experience and next time i'm in the area i will definitely be staying here | i'd recommend the millennium knickerbocker to anyone traveling to chicago | |i chose to stay at the 'millennium knickerbocker hotel' during a recent trip to chicago because i had heard they had good reviews | boy were these reviews wrong | | i had terrible service from the moment i walked in the doors | i was not greeted by the receptionist it was like i wasn't even there | my room was not ready for me when i got there even though i got there after my required check-in time then once i was allowed to go to my room it was filthy | it was as if they didn't even clean it so i don't know what the hold up was | there were no towels shampoo or soap in the bathroom | the worst part was that there were bugs in the tub | the place was the most disgusting place i've ever been to and it is supposed to be one of the nicest | it should be the nicest for the price they charge | i do not recommend staying here | stay at your own risk | | |while it was a nice hotel but i am rather frustrated with them | during our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping | the first day was fine | second day my diamond earrings came up missing | noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process | my biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further | but we had a family reunion and funeral to get to | while the front desk was great and said they would handle it i believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way | we filed a police report and the gm of the hotel is supposed to be working on it | we have called several times but receive no answers | they keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 + years | | | | |that dosen't matter to me | if they are not held accountable what's to stop them from taking anything | there is a dishwasher in the room and they found my daughters ring which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings in the dishwasher | they say i put the cup in the dishwasher | first i am on vacation trust me i'm not doing dishes | second why would i wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room | so while it is a nice hotel | | | |lock up your things of value | they may come up missing and you'll be left frustrated | | |my family and i were in chicago for a friend's wedding | we had asked around to find a hotel that was nice but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the intercontinental chicago hotel | the hotel appeared very nice and to have all the amenities room service wifi clean rooms | unfortunately as it turned out appearances can be deceiving | it begins at the desk where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring | he said they didn't have any rooms available because we didn't make arrangements | it was getting late and we had no place to go there weren't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving | i asked if there was anything he could do and he said that i will have to ask someone else because he was busy | i talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night | apparently our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard because this room wasn't even clean and the wifi didn't work | we ordered room service and it never came even after several complaints | it doesn't end there either when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service | overall this was a very frustrating experience and i wouldn't stay there again | |conrad - i was extremely unhappy with the attitude of this hotel's staff toward customer satisfaction | i specifically asked for a big room on one of the lower floor because i have fear for heights but instead they put me on the top floor of their building | when i asked for an exchange they said they were full | would not come again | |homewood suites- i wish i had nicer things to say about this hotel- my most recent trip to chicago was actually pretty enjoyable but only because i didn't have to spend too much time in my hotel room | the room was filthy i came in to see some strange pair of underwear on my bed | it took room service all day to come by and take care of it | then there was the issue with the car- i needed to bring my car on this particular visit to the windy city and the hotel charged me $42 a day to keep it in their lot | outrageous if you ask me | i will give credit where credit is due though and say that the pool was lovely | but the gym was disgusting and sweaty | the absolutely need to clean up their act if they ever want my business again | |excellent staff and customer service very clean and spotless | elegant and luxurious with a beautiful ocean view | the bed is very comfortable and relaxing | i give it a five star | |the talbott hotel was very classy professional and luxurious | i loved how the staff was nice and respectful | i was treated like i was royalty when i was there when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel | they took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done | this is a very nice and modern looking and their rooms are spacious and clean unlike other hotels in their area | i have recommended this hotel to all of my family and friends and would recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in that area | |this hotel is in a great city with great personnel working there | the rooms are more than you can expect for a hotel | the services are abundant leaving no room to complain | with their fine diners you cannot go wrong with enjoying a peaceful meal while relaxing | with this hotel it is truly an all-in-one hotel | there are meeting rooms and business centers leaving unfinished work not be a worry during the stay | in addition the spacious swimming pool is just the thing needed to relieve yourself of stress | the views from the rooms are breathtaking | i would definitely recommend staying there | |the hotel definitely doesn't match its 4 |5 rating | the receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest and i don't feel welcome at all | i booked a non-smoking room but upon arrival the receptionist told me that there was no non-smoking room left | of course he was lying | i argued with him for 5 minutes before he reluctantly gave me a non-smoking room | at checkout they tried to charge me $40 upgrade fee each day because i requested a non-smoking room | this was completely ridiculous | i had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges | the room was quite small the tv was broken so i had to call someone to fix the tv | then the wireless network banned my ip address so i had to talk to their tech-support -- the tech support was quite friendly knowledgeable and helpful -- i guess this was the only bright point of the stay | |i stayed here in the last weekend of september 2010 for the bears vs packers monday night game | my room rocked | i had a pretty big flat screen and a super soft bed | the room was clean and stylish and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out | my favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home | i definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax | |the conrad chicago hotel had some of the worst service i have ever dealt with | i got the executive room with a king size bed | when i got in the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud | i called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me | they have a pillow menu which i tried to select from but they were out of over half of them | the ipod dock was not working either | also the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm | this hotel is the worst in chicago and i would never recommend going there |
